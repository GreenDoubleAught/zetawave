	* CYCLE will track what day it is, what part of the day,
	  and which passages are to control events of that day.
	* Each story will have a list of passage names (such as &quot;1941-Day&quot;
	  or &quot;1965-Afterschool&quot;), so CYCLE can direct the game to refer
	  to whatever passages are required. Since not all stories will be
	  set in the same environment -- at work, at school -- each story can
	  thus have its own list of required passages. Stories can also share
	  passages for generic activities (eg, bathing, sleeping) or for
	  certain activities that must share mechanical effects on stats
	  (like working out). The &quot;Working Out&quot; passage from multiple eras
	  can refer to a single Working Out Calculation passage to keep the
	  code in one place.
	* This structure means CYCLE must have a single array that tracks
	  the list of passages, how long that list is, and where we are now.
	  However, it also means that we could (in theory) skip to a new
	  day-part by manually cycling that variable.
	  
There needs to be a SETUP passage for each era.
	* The SETUP passage will establish the list of passages that must
	  be consulted by CYCLE, as well as the starting date and any other
	  relevant details.

There must be a MASTER passage that controls access to the various eras.
	* The MASTER passage will check to see which passages are available
	  and establish links for the ones which are.
	* The MASTER passage may also link to the BOOK, which puts the
	  player&#39;s story into a medical context.
	  
There must be a BOOK which reflects the player&#39;s accumulated decisions and how they affect the future of the Zeta Wave phenomenon. The player can only refer to a BOOK passage after having completed the related scenario.
	* To keep track of the BOOK, I must have a shorthand for outcomes
	  that can be boiled down to a this-or-that variable. For instance,
	  75% of all the players&#39; playthroughs were MTF and ended up in
	  pregnancy, or 95% of all playthroughs changed sexual orientation,
	  or whatever.
	* The BOOK will not have any special interactivity to it, except to
	  be able to reset all the variables (with a warning that this will
	  start the game over from the beginning).

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You push your feet out of bed, searching for your slippers, and sit on the edge of the bed to collect your thoughts. What //was// that weird dream that woke you up, anyway?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Shaking off sleep, you head toward the bathroom. You make it as far as the toilet before coming to the final, fatal realization: you&#39;re a $girlboy[$gen].&lt;/div&gt;

	openly as a Zeta. (This is different from the case that the player
	is a KNOWNZETA, which simply means that the school is aware of the

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Vaguely, you recall something about being //stuck// in your dream. Trying to ... something. It was probably the blankets, all tangled up. You remember $so, too, and you remember being there on the bed, but everything else is a confusing blank. Whatever it was you were dreaming out, it was very intense. You feel like you&#39;re on fire, shaking all over. Thirsty.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You reach in the dark for your bedside glass of water and take a sip. Maybe the dream will be there when you fall asleep again. It seemed nice.&lt;/div&gt;

Your nightgown doesn&#39;t do anything to conceal the fact that you&#39;re packing some new equipment down there, or that you&#39;re missing a few things up top.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; You&#39;re going to need to do something about that.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&lt;&lt;if $startsex == &quot;male&quot;&gt;&gt;Luckily, you don&#39;t have any girly breasts or anything yet, so all you need is a strategic pair of socks.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;Luckily, all it takes is a little toilet tissue to fill out your bra, and a couple pairs of underwear and a girdle to hide the telltale lump.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You creep downstairs, holding your abdomen for theatrical effect, and go into the kitchen to use the telephone. After asking the operator ELliot-6251, you listen carefully for any telltale signs of breathing while $fr&#39;s number rings on the other end.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;At that moment, Mom walks into the kitchen and starts stirring up some Malt-O-Meal for $sibnick&#39;s breakfast. She ignores you, standing in your socks by the telephone, but it still makes you nervous.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Hello?&quot; It&#39;s $fr&#39;s mother.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Hello, Mrs Lenford,&quot; you say. &quot;Can I speak with $fr, please?&quot; You don&#39;t really want to dawdle in the kitchen under your mom&#39;s scrutiny, but you learned good telephone manners through scouting and you can&#39;t just stop now.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;In a minute, $fr comes on the line. &quot;Hello? $name?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Good, you haven&#39;t left for school yet,&quot; you say, and explain about the need for homework. &quot;Could you stop by my classes and pick it up, and then bring it by?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Why, what&#39;s wrong?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Mom is still stirring away at the stove, so you say, &quot;I&#39;m not feeling quite myself. A little under the weather. I&#39;ll tell you later.&quot; At a glance from your mother, you add, &quot;It&#39;s nothing important. I don&#39;t want to make you late for school.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;That seemed to do the trick. Now to go back to your room and try to figure out what&#39;s happening.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;&lt;if $day == 3&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;display &quot;SetDress&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;if $cross == true and $sex == &quot;male&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;The outfit your mother chose for you is a pair of dark blue slacks, a white men&#39;s shirt with red buttons, one of Pop&#39;s blue ties, and a light blue cardigan.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;It all fits pretty well, considering. The white underwear is much more comfortable for your cock than those tight panties you usually wear. The buttons are backward on the shirt, but you figure it all out except the tie, which you aren&#39;t sure how to wear. Fortunately, there&#39;s a section in the Girl Scout guide on knot-tying, so you look up a half-Windsor knot and figure it out yourself. It takes a couple of tries to get the length right, and you still have to tuck the end of the tie into your shirt so it doesn&#39;t stick out the bottom of the sweater.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You check yourself out in the mirror in the upstairs hallway. You look a little rumpled and confused, but not bad. Everything looks just right, except for the long hair. It&#39;s always //something,// isn&#39;t it?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Mom catches you in the hallway. A pair of silver scissors glints in her hand. &quot;All right,&quot; she says. &quot;Let&#39;s cut that hair.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;&lt;set $fhair to 5&gt;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Mom!&quot; you protest.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;You have to stick to the dress code,&quot; she says implacably. &quot;Now come downstairs and we&#39;ll get that trimmed off in a jiffy.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;elseif $cross == true and $sex == &quot;female&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;The outfit your mother chose for you is a pale blue dress with frilly white lace pockets on the skirt. There&#39;s also a pair of black patent-leather shoes, a yellow cardigan, and, of course, the inevitable: a white bra and an unfamiliar pair of panties.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You&#39;re wrestling with the bra when Mom knocks on your door again. &quot;Are you decent?&quot; she asks, sticking her head in.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Mom!&quot; you say, practically naked, wearing only panties, with your arms tangled in the bra straps. &quot;I thought you told $sib not to open doors like that.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I&#39;m your mother,&quot; she says, unperturbed, and points to the bed. &quot;Sit. I&#39;ve got to trim your toenails.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Why? Nobody&#39;s going to see them.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;You have to keep them trimmed or you&#39;ll get a run in your stockings.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Stockings?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;You heard me. The war&#39;s over. Ladies are wearing nylon stockings again. No more bare legs. Not for you, anyway — we&#39;ll talk about getting your legs shaved properly tonight. Now hold still and give me those toes.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;After trimming your toenails, Mom shows you how to roll up a pair of white stockings and unroll them up your legs. &quot;Now you do this one,&quot; she says, handing it to you. &quot;What have you //done// to this brassiere? It&#39;s all twisted into a — oh, there we go.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;After you get the stockings on, she womanhandles the bra onto your body. &quot;You don&#39;t need one, not really,&quot; she notes, &quot;but people will notice if you&#39;re not wearing one, trust me.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;But—&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;if $path.includes(&quot;sock stuffing&quot;)&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;We&#39;ll add a little padding, too,&quot; she decides, stuffing your cups with a modest amount of toilet tissue. &quot;Just so you don&#39;t look so flat. All right, the dress. Arms up!&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;This was your idea,&quot; she reminds you. &quot;I&#39;m just trying to see that you&#39;re dressed for school. Now: arms up.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;\
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;She drops the dress over your head, and you wriggle into the short sleeve holes. &quot;I&#39;ll get the buttons in the back,&quot; Mom says. &quot;It takes a little practice to get them right. Remember, if you have a dress like this with very short sleeves, you should always wear a sweater so you don&#39;t show off your bare shoulders. Oh, and I&#39;ll ask your father if we can pick up a tall mirror for you — you&#39;ll need one to get these buttons on your own. And a vanity, too.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;What&#39;s a vanity?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;A little table for doing makeup.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Do I have to wear makeup?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Yes, you do,&quot; she says, finishing the last button and picking up a sizeable case full of tubes and powders. She starts applying creams and powders to your face, dabbing here and patting there with a fragrant little pouf. &quot;People will notice if you&#39;re not wearing anything. You don&#39;t want anyone to recognize you, do you? I didn&#39;t think so. Now hold still while I do this.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;At last, your face is made up to your mother&#39;s satisfaction. In the mirror, it looks like nothing much at all, considering how much effort went into it. Your skin looks smooth, your lips look pink, and your eyebrows a little darker. Maybe your lashes are thicker from the mascara. You reach up to touch your pink cheeks.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Don&#39;t touch,&quot; Mom admonishes you, smacking your hand. &quot;You&#39;ll get smudges. Now, I&#39;ve got a wig for you, and we&#39;re going to secure it on with bobby pins so it doesn&#39;t fall off. If you&#39;re going to stay like this, your hair will grow out, and we won&#39;t need it any more, but until then you&#39;ll have to be careful, okay?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;When she&#39;s all done with you, there&#39;s a certain Alice-in-Wonderland quality to the girl you see in the mirror: pink, pretty, and puzzled.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You go through your closet, looking for something else to wear that is equal to the concealment you managed to pull off yesterday. &lt;&lt;if $startsex == &quot;male&quot;&gt;&gt;A blazer, some slacks, a nice shirt. A tie.&lt;&lt;if $path.includes(&quot;sock stuffing&quot;)&gt;&gt; An extra sock in your underwear.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; You feel like a bit of an imposter.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;A heavy woolen skirt, a blouse, a sweater. The dreaded girdle.&lt;&lt;if $path.includes(&quot;bra stuffing&quot;)&gt;&gt; More toilet tissue for the empty bra.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; You feel like a bit of an imposter.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Maybe nobody will recognize &lt;&lt;if $path.includes(&quot;shameful TG&quot;)&gt;&gt;you at school.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;at school again today.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; Maybe. But that would take luck, and you haven&#39;t had much of that in the last twenty-four hours.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Mom comes in to check on you, and gives a faint nod of approval. It looks like this is as good as you&#39;re going to get.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;&lt;if $cross == true&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;It looks as if your mother has found some more helpful PTA parents with hand-me-down clothing, because your pile of $sex clothing has grown quite a bit since yesterday. You look through it and find something suitable to wear.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You still feel a bit like you&#39;re wearing a Hallowe&#39;en costume.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You scrounge through your clothing, looking for something to wear that doesn&#39;t give away the changes to your body. After some searching, you find something suitable to wear. &lt;&lt;if $path.includes(&quot;sock stuffing&quot;)&gt;&gt;You replace your sock stuffing in the front of your trousers with the rubber band, now looking slightly frayed.&lt;&lt;elseif $path.includes(&quot;bra stuffing&quot;)&gt;&gt;You replace the toilet tissue stuffed in your bra with fresh sheets that don&#39;t look so lumpy.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;It looks good, but not really all //that// good.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Why does it feel like you&#39;re wearing a disguise?&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;No, like I said, I was making out with $so earlier that day,&quot; you explain slowly. &quot;And then that night I had that dream, like me and $so were about to ... you know, //do// it. That&#39;s all I can figure.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Gee whiz,&quot; $fr says, dumbfounded but happy. &quot;What&#39;s it like?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;It&#39;s not like anything, really,&quot; you say. &quot;It&#39;s hard to explain. I mean, I&#39;m not &lt;&lt;if $sex == &quot;female&quot;&gt;&gt;going all girly and chasing after boys&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;going all weird in the head and chasing after girls&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; or anything.

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;So you&#39;re going to dress like a $girlboy[$oppgen], right?&quot; $so asks, lowering $poss[$sogen] voice. &quot;We want to look completely normal. If this works, then everything goes back to the way it was.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Knock on wood,&quot; you murmur.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;We should go for dinner,&quot; $so says. &quot;There&#39;s an Ivar&#39;s Seafood place near my house.&quot; $nomcap[$sogen] pauses. &quot;I think you should treat. After all, this is //your// idea.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Okay,&quot; you say. &quot;I&#39;ve saved up a little bit of my allowance.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Don&#39;t worry, it&#39;s not expensive,&quot; $nom[$sogen] assures you. &quot;They have creamed crab on toast for only a dollar and ten cents. I like the halibut myself, but if we&#39;re going to do this, we should really have the oyster fry.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Why?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;My friend &lt;&lt;if $sogen == 4&gt;&gt;Mabel&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;Chester&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; was telling me that oysters are good for ... you know.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Ah, right,&quot; you say. &quot;For ... yes.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;elseif $path.includes(&quot;friend date&quot;)&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;set _comp to $fr&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;set _cgen to $fgen&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;At lunch, you sit with $fr, trying to work out the details of your upcoming date. &lt;&lt;if $openzeta == true&gt;&gt;You can tell $fr feels a little uncomfortable sitting across from someone of your recent celebrity.

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;So you&#39;re going to dress like a $girlboy[$gen], right?&quot; $fr asks, lowering $poss[$frgen] voice. &quot;I don&#39;t want anybody to notice anything. If it works, we&#39;ll just have to find a way to sneak you home without anybody seeing you.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;That&#39;s //if// it works,&quot; you murmur.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I think we should go before dinner, and eat out,&quot; $fr says. &quot;That gives us lots of time to find a good quiet place without anybody watching.&quot; &lt;&lt;if $fgen == 3&gt;&gt;$nomcap[$fgen] pauses. &quot;Do you mind if this is your treat? I don&#39;t have any allowance until Sunday.&quot;&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;$nomcap[$fgen] grins. &quot;And it should still be your treat.

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;That&#39;s fair,&quot; you say. &quot;I&#39;ve got a little bit saved up.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;

They&#39;re only sixty cents.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; Unless you think it&#39;s true what they say about oysters.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;What do they say??&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;My friend &lt;&lt;if $sogen == 4&gt;&gt;Mabel&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;Chester&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; was telling me that oysters are good for ... you know.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Do you think it would work better with a girl or with a boy?&quot; $fr asks.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;What? I don&#39;t know. What kind of question is that?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Well, you know,&quot; $fr says, waggling $poss[$fgen] fork to suggest complicated reasoning. &quot;You&#39;re a $girlboy[$gen] now, so maybe a $girlboy[$oppgen] would be better...&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;How should I know?&quot; you ask. &quot;It&#39;s not like I&#39;ve been going around ... kissing everyone to see what it&#39;s like.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Why don&#39;t you go take a powder?&quot; _comp asks. &quot;Go have a bite to eat before they empty your favorite trash cans.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;&lt;if $day == 2&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;if $path.includes(&quot;shameful TG&quot;)&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;In the late afternoon, the house starts to fill up with noise again. Mom is cooking dinner, $sib has arrived from school and clattered up the stairs, and the sound of traffic in the neighborhood has increased. $fr should already be home from the first day of school. Now you just have to find a moment to tell $acc[$fgen] what&#39;s going on with you.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Fortunately, $fr calls the house just before four o&#39;clock, saying $nom[$fgen] has your homework from school.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Thanks, &lt;&lt;if $startsex == &quot;male&quot;&gt;&gt;pal,&quot;&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;you&#39;re a peach,&quot;&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; you say over the phone. &quot;Can you come over and drop it off?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Your mother, who is listening with half an ear while she prepares a pot roast, says, &quot;Come over? Honey, you&#39;re sick.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I&#39;m feeling a little better,&quot; you say. &quot;It&#39;s aces, mom.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;She gives you a skeptical look. &quot;All right. Now go get dressed. You can&#39;t have friends over in your &lt;&lt;if $startsex == &quot;male&quot;&gt;&gt;pajamas.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;nightgown.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; And if your little friend gets sick, I&#39;m calling $poss[$fgen] parents and telling them why.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Half an hour later, $fr pedals over on $poss[$fgen] bike to hand-deliver your homework instructions.&lt;/div&gt;
--&lt;&lt;link &quot;tell your friend what happened&quot; &quot;1948 Best Friend Chat&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;set $page to 0&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;/link&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;set $newknowns to [31]&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;display &quot;NewKnowns&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;There&#39;s no homework on the first day of school, not unless you count reading Act One of that Shakespeare play. That should leave you plenty of time to meet up with $fr and explain what&#39;s going on. You&#39;ll have to walk, because Mom never picks you up from school. In the afternoons she&#39;s usually too busy cooking. You walk home as quickly as you dare.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;if $path.includes(&quot;reveal TG&quot;)&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;When you arrive home, Mom gives you a worried hug. &quot;How did everything go today, $name?&quot; she asks. &quot;Did anything ... change back to the way it was?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;No, Mom, it didn&#39;t,&quot; you admit, turning pink. &quot;It&#39;s still ... the same.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;All right,&quot; she says, withdrawing and wiping her hands unconsciously on her apron. &quot;I&#39;ve already called the school and arranged to talk to the principal later tonight. When your father gets home, we&#39;re going to call him up and explain the whole thing. I hate to interrupt Mr Fordyce with a telephone call between six and seven, but it can&#39;t be helped. After dinner, we&#39;ll try to sort out what else we can do. Oh, and you have an appointment with Dr Bennett on Monday.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Thanks, Mom,&quot; you say. &quot;By the way, is it okay if $fr comes over tonight? I ... I told $acc[$fgen] about what happened, but I said I&#39;d explain everything later after school.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;That&#39;s fine, dear,&quot; she says. &quot;And if $fr needs to use the telephone to tell $poss[$fgen] parents where $nom[$fgen] is, that&#39;s fine. As long as it&#39;s not long distance.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;$nomcap[$fgen] goes to my school, Mom,&quot; you remind her.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;When you arrive home, Mom gives you a happy hug. &quot;How was your first day, $name?&quot; she asks. &quot;Do you like all your classes?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Sure, they&#39;re fine,&quot; you say. &quot;It&#39;s, you know. It&#39;s school.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;You&#39;re usually more excited about school than that,&quot; she says, withdrawing and giving you a look of mild concern. &quot;Well, you&#39;ll probably like them better as the year goes on. You usually do. Don&#39;t forget, dinner will be at six, so be sure &lt;&lt;if $startsex == &quot;female&quot;&gt;&gt;you and $sibnick set the table by then.&quot;&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;you&#39;re ready to eat on time.&quot;&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Thanks, Mom, I will.&quot; you say. &quot;Oh, is it okay if $fr comes over tonight? We haven&#39;t seen each other all summer, and we just wanted to catch up a bit.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;That&#39;s fine, dear,&quot; she says. &quot;And if $fr needs to use the telephone to tell $poss[$fgen] parents where $nom[$fgen] is, that&#39;s fine. As long as it&#39;s not long distance.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;$nomcap[$fgen] goes to my school, Mom,&quot; you remind her.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;&lt;if $day == 3&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;When you get home, Mom is waiting near the door with her keys in her hand. &quot;You&#39;re here?&quot; she asks. &quot;Good. Will you keep an eye on the oven, and when the timer goes off, will you check the bread? I have to go pick up your sister.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;if $startsex == &quot;female&quot;&gt;&gt;&quot;Of course,&quot; you say, setting down your satchel of books. It seems lighter today, for some reason. &quot;How long does it have?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Fifteen minutes. I got it in the oven late. Thanks, sweetheart!&quot; She delivers a quick kiss on the cheek and dashes out the door.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;How do I check bread?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Oh — I forgot, you&#39;re not a girl,&quot; she says, flustered. &quot;I guess I was thinking — all you have to do is take a wooden skewer and poke it through the middle. If the skewer comes out with dough on it, put it back in for five more minutes.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I can do that.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Thanks, sweetheart!&quot; she says and gives you a quick kiss on the cheek. A moment later, she has dashed out the door.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;\
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;The house is gloriously empty, for once.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;It occurs to you that this is the perfect time to make plans for tomorrow night, when there&#39;s nobody in the house to overhear you. $sibnick isn&#39;t around, Mom just left, and Pop won&#39;t be home for hours. It&#39;s not any old time that you can call someone up and ask if they want to go out necking in the park. And how else are you going to find out if this condition goes the other way?&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I didn&#39;t have time to find very much,&quot; $nom[$sogen] says, &quot;but this should &lt;&lt;if $path.includes(&quot;date revealed&quot;)&gt;&gt;do for tonight.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;help a little for now.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; Also, Mom wasn&#39;t home, so this was all I could fit on my bike. I&#39;ll try to find more and bring them over on Sunday.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Your mother, of course, is happy to see $so, but a little suspicious of $acc[$sogen] as well. &quot;You know about $name&#39;s ... condition?&quot; she asks, wiping her hands on a kitchen towel.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Oh, yes, Mrs $lastname,&quot; $so says. &quot;$name told me.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&lt;&lt;if $path.includes(&quot;reveal TG&quot;)&gt;&gt;&quot;It&#39;s all very peculiar, isn&#39;t it?&quot; Mom asks, glancing at you.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;&quot;Did $nom[$oppgen]?&quot; Mom asks coolly, glancing at you. &quot;I had to find out from $sibnick, $poss[$oppgen] sister. Anyway, it&#39;s very peculiar, isn&#39;t it?&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; You wouldn&#39;t know anything else about it, I hope?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;No,&quot; $so says, and sounds fairly truthful, too.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Mom clearly doesn&#39;t buy it. &quot;I see,&quot; she says in guarded tones. &quot;Well, thank you for bringing over something for $name to wear. &lt;&lt;if $secret == true&gt;&gt;I was going to suggest it myself, but $name didn&#39;t want anyone to find out yet.&quot;&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;I should have called your mother and asked myself, I suppose, but I didn&#39;t think of it.&quot;&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;if $path.includes(&quot;date revealed&quot;)&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;if $sex == &quot;female&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Upstairs, $so shows you what $nom[$sogen] brought. &quot;It&#39;s a dress for tonight, a sweater, and some nylons. Oh, and &lt;&lt;if $secret == true&gt;&gt;I didn&#39;t know if you needed one, so&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;just in case,&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; I brought one of my old brassieres. Do you know what size shoes you wear? I have a couple of pairs that go with this dress. Let&#39;s see if they fit.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Shouldn&#39;t I try on the dress first?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;If the shoes don&#39;t fit, you&#39;ll need a different dress,&quot; $so says. &quot;Come on, let me help you try these on. You don&#39;t have a lot of time before your date.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;But it&#39;s only four.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Already? We have to shake a leg. You still have to have a bath and put on your skin lotion! And then you&#39;ll have to do your makeup — here, let me show you.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;elseif $sex == &quot;male&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Upstairs, $so shows you what $nom[$sogen] brought. &quot;I have a jacket and some trousers, and a nice shirt. I don&#39;t know if the jacket is going to fit, but it might. We should probably check.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;All right,&quot; you say. &quot;Did you bring shoes?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Oh yeah, you should try those on, too. Are you going to have a bath before your date? You probably should. And shave, too.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;My legs? Why?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;No, your face,&quot; $so says. &quot;Remember how you don&#39;t like it when I have stubble on my face, how you say it&#39;s scratchy?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Oh, right,&quot; you say, remembering.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;And I pre-tied this tie for you,&quot; he says. &quot;I usually leave them like this so I don&#39;t have to tie them. Just hold the knot and pull right here, see? Here, let me show you.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;\
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;It takes a few minutes before $so is satisfied that you know your way around your outfit for the evening. &quot;All right,&quot; $nom[$sogen] says. &quot;I have to go. &lt;&lt;if $sex == &quot;male&quot;&gt;&gt;Good luck.&quot;&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;I&#39;m //dying// to hear how it goes.

I have to go soon, and I still have to show you what makeup I brought. Besides, I can&#39;t let you have //all// my shoes.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;elseif $sex == &quot;male&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Upstairs, $so shows you what $nom[$sogen] brought. &quot;I have a jacket and some trousers, and a nice shirt. I don&#39;t know if the jacket is going to fit, but it might. We should probably check.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;All right,&quot; you say. &quot;Did you bring shoes?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Oh yeah, you should try those on, too. And I brought you an extra razor, in case you need one.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I have a razor,&quot; you say. &quot;For my legs.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I know,&quot; he says. &quot;This one is for your face. It&#39;s sharper, probably, so be careful.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;\
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;It takes a few minutes before $so is satisfied that you know your way around your new outfit. &quot;Okay, I gotta scram,&quot; $so says. &quot;Lots to do tonight. Call me on Sunday, maybe we can get together.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;\
&lt;&lt;elseif $path.includes(&quot;friend date&quot;)&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;if $secret == true&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;As soon as you get home from school, you have to solve the problem of what to wear tonight. Your whole //future// could depend on getting this one date right. $fr is going to help you, sure, but only if you dress like a $girlboy[$gen] somehow. There&#39;s only one thing you can do: raid your &lt;&lt;if $sex == &quot;male&quot;&gt;&gt;father&#39;s&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;mother&#39;s&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; closet.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;if $sex == &quot;male&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;When your mother leaves the house to pick up $sibnick from school, you dash into your parents&#39; bedroom and start to go through his things. You know one end of his closet contains his older clothes, the kind of things he used to wear when he came out of the Army and was still very trim. Those might just fit you.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Frantically, you paw through his shirts and trousers, looking for anything that will fit. You manage to find a jacket, a white shirt and a pair of double-knit trousers that aren&#39;t too old-fashioned, and you pick out a matching tie. The shoes are a bit of a problem, but you find if you wear three pairs of socks they fit well enough. You creep back to your room with your stolen wardrobe just as Mom is pulling up in the driveway with $sibnick.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;When your mother leaves the house to pick up $sibnick from school, you dash into your parents&#39; bedroom and start to go through his things. You know one end of her closet contains her older clothes, the kind of things she used to wear when you and $sibnick were younger and she had a trimmer figure. Those might just fit you.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Frantically, you paw through her skirts and blouses and dresses, looking for anything that will fit. You manage to find a simple yellow dress that&#39;s only a //little// old-fashioned, and you pick out a sweater to wear over it. You really want to leave her brassieres in the drawer, because you have no idea what you&#39;re looking for, but you //do// need to look like a girl, and that means you&#39;ll have to have a little something up top. A bra could hold some socks or toilet tissue or something. You also have to take a pair of her nylons. The war is over, and girls aren&#39;t going around with bare legs any more.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;The shoes are a problem. Most of them are a bit too small, and some of the ones that fit have heels. You manage to find a pair of shoes that you can get your feet into, and you creep back to your room with your stolen wardrobe just as Mom is pulling up in the driveway with $sibnick.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;\
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;The real challenge is going to be getting out of the house with this outfit. You can&#39;t expect to just waltz out the front door wearing your &lt;&lt;if $sex == &quot;female&quot;&gt;&gt;mother&#39;s dress,&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;father&#39;s clothes,&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; to say nothing of hopping on your bike and riding down the driveway. You decide to bundle it all up into a satchel and drop it out your bedroom window. If you&#39;re lucky, you&#39;ll be able to grab the satchel, find a hedge or something to change behind, and come back later for your old clothes. It could work.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;As soon as you get home, you have to start getting ready for your date. You&#39;re still not entirely accustomed to dressing like a $girlboy[$gen], and you figure you&#39;re going to need as much time as you can get. Your whole future could depend on getting this date right tonight.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;if $sex == &quot;female&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You just had a bath the night before, but there&#39;s no harm in taking another. &lt;&lt;if $secret == true&gt;&gt;Besides, you&#39;re going to have to shave your legs if this disguise is going to work. It&#39;s too bad you don&#39;t have a wig or something so your hair looks more girly, but that&#39;s the way it goes. Perhaps if you wear a pretty hat, nobody will notice.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;Thankfully, you already shaved your legs, so that&#39;ll save a bit of time, which you&#39;ll be able to use getting the wig on.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;After your bath, you pick out an outfit that looks fairly good: a pretty melon-colored dress with your yellow sweater, some white stockings, and dark brown shoes. It takes a little time to get your makeup right. You&#39;re still not used to it, but you&#39;re getting better.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;elseif $sex == &quot;male&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You just had a bath the night before, but there&#39;s no harm taking another. You seem to have more of a problem with body odor as a boy than you did before. Is that why boys smell so strongly? They just can&#39;t help it?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;After your bath, you check your face in the mirror. You&#39;re not sure what to do with it, since you don&#39;t need to wear makeup, so you give it a wash and feel a little bit scratchy stubble on your chin. Better take a razor to that — very carefully.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;The last thing to work on is your hair. &lt;&lt;if $secret == true&gt;&gt;The trouble is, boys don&#39;t wear their hair long like this, and you don&#39;t want to cut it. After all, how will you continue attending school as a girl on Monday if you chop off your hair tonight? No, a baseball cap will have to do.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;Luckily, your mother cut it nice and short, so it doesn&#39;t take long to dry. There isn&#39;t much you need to do with it except give it a good comb.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;\
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;It&#39;s not a bad outfit, you decide, checking yourself in the hall mirror. Luckily, $sibnick doesn&#39;t notice you preening and studying your reflection.&lt;/div&gt;

It won&#39;t take hours, thankfully, but you are going to make to make certain your disguise stands up. You have to look like a $girlboy[$oppgen], and you just don&#39;t //feel// that much like one any more.&lt;/div&gt;

The shirt is too baggy, and there&#39;s something missing in the trousers. &lt;&lt;if $path.includes(&quot;sock stuffing&quot;&gt;&gt;You&#39;re tempted to put another sock down there, but what&#39;s the point? People would just tease you about it anyway.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;You&#39;re tempted to put a sock down there, but people would probably just tease you for it.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;which doesn&#39;t feel like it fits you any more. Your shaved legs feel smooth and sensitive in your trouser legs, and the fabric keeps clinging to your skin.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; You have to wear a couple different pairs of socks to get your shoes to fit.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You get dressed in your girls&#39; clothing, &lt;&lt;if $secret == true&gt;&gt;which still doesn&#39;t feel like it fits you. The dress is snug around the shoulders, there&#39;s an awkward lump beneath the skirt that&#39;s hard to conceal, and you&#39;re completely flat up top. &lt;&lt;if $path.includes(&quot;bra stuffing&quot;)&gt;&gt;You&#39;re tempted to put more tissue paper in your bra, but people would probably just tease you for it.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;You&#39;re tempted to put some tissue paper in your bra, but what&#39;s the point? People would just tease you for it anyway.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;if $secret == true&gt;&gt;At least you still have long hair, which helps to hide your face a little. Some makeup would also help complete the look, so you don&#39;t look so much like a boy in a dress.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;With your hair cut boyishly short, it doesn&#39;t do much to help the overall impression that you&#39;re just a boy in a dress.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; Maybe, if you squint just right, a boyish-looking girl.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;set _havedate to false&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You arrive home and flop down on your bed, exhausted. It&#39;s been such a strange week.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You want to try to relax and not think about the troubles you had at school, but your thoughts are already turning to your scout meeting tomorrow. How are you going to show up there looking like //this?//&lt;/div&gt;

Pop hangs his hat inside the door and flops down in his easy chair to take off his shoes and read the paper for a few minutes, as is his habit.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;$name, come set the table, your father&#39;s home,&quot; Mom shouts up the stairs.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I&#39;m right here, ma,&quot; you say. &quot;Why can&#39;t $sibnick do it? I&#39;ve got to get ready for the first day of school tomorrow.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&lt;&lt;if $sex == &quot;male&quot;&gt;&gt;&quot;Because $sibnick is still outside playing. I&#39;ll call her in while you set the table,&quot;&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;&quot;I don&#39;t care which one of you girls does it, and $sibnick is outside playing,&quot;&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; Mom says, wiping her hands on her apron. &quot;There&#39;s plenty of time to get ready for tomorrow after you have dinner.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Grumbling, you haul four dishes out of the kitchen cabinets and set everything out: plates, forks, knives, spoons, glasses, napkins.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&lt;&lt;if $sex == &quot;male&quot;&gt;&gt;&quot;Did you wash your hands?&quot; Mom asks. She licks her fingertips and tries to smooth down your cowlick. &quot;Go comb your hair. And when $sibnick comes in, make her run a brush through those tangles, too.&quot;&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;&quot;Don&#39;t forget to wash your hands and fix your hair,&quot; Mom reminds you. &quot;And when $sibnick gets in, make her scrub her face. I&#39;m sure she&#39;s got dirt everywhere. Make her run a brush through those tangles, too.&quot;&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;By the time Pop gets to the table, his tie is loosened, his shoes are off, and he&#39;s got the newspaper tucked under one arm and a highball glass with a whiskey and soda in the other hand that Mom made for him. &quot;You&#39;re looking very pretty tonight, girls,&quot; he says to &lt;&lt;if $sex == &quot;male&quot;&gt;&gt;Mom and $sib,&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;the three of you,&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; folding the newspaper under the corner of his plate. &quot;That&#39;s good, at least.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Mother gives you and $sibnick a warning look that says //don&#39;t ask your father about the news.// It&#39;s well known that Pop didn&#39;t care for anything he read in the paper lately. If it isn&#39;t the Russians creeping around, or the French government collapsing again, it&#39;s the specter of Communists like Alger Hiss looming behind every headline. He doesn&#39;t even have the Seattle Pilots to fall back on, &lt;&lt;if $sex == &quot;male&quot;&gt;&gt;because this summer they weren&#39;t much better than //bad//, and the St Louis Browns (his second love) were even worse.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;at least according to his endless grumbling over the sports section this summer.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Today, $sibnick must have missed Mom&#39;s Look, because she asks, &quot;Why, is something bad?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Nothing, sugar,&quot; Pop says to her, but he looks across the table at Mom, taps the newspaper, and mouths the word //polio.//&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;&lt;if $day == 2&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;if $path.includes(&quot;reveal TG&quot;)&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;There&#39;s already pot roast on the table when Pop gets home, and Mom rushes everyone through dinner as quickly as possible.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;No, $sibnick,&quot; she says wearily to your younger sister. &quot;Don&#39;t play with the carrots. You //like// carrots. We have an important phone call to make, and if you can&#39;t finish your supper like a good girl, you&#39;ll have to take it and finish it upstairs in your room. Cold.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Whining, instinctively realizing she&#39;s being excluded from this momentous phone call — she couldn&#39;t possibly know what it is — $sib says, &quot;C&#39;mon, Mom, can&#39;t I—&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;No, not tonight. Go on, scoot.&quot; Your mother watches $sibnick drag her feet out of the dining room, carrying the remains of her pot roast, until you finally hear her step on the stair treads and the sound of her bedroom door closing.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;All right, Earl, let&#39;s come to a decision,&quot; Mom says briskly, pushing her plate toward the center and folding her hands on the table. &quot;What are we going to do about $name?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;You&#39;ve called Dr Bennett?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Yes. $name is going in first thing on Monday.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;elseif $path.includes(&quot;Dot tattled&quot;)&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;The pot roast is a little late getting to the table, given the dramatics this afternoon, but Mom gamely rushes everyone through the meal as quickly as possible.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;All right, $sibnick,&quot; she says to your younger sister. &quot;You&#39;re going to have to take it and finish it upstairs in your room. Your father and $name and I have some things we have to talk about, and you&#39;re in enough trouble already.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Whining, instinctively realizing she&#39;s being excluded from this momentous conversation, $sib says, &quot;C&#39;mon, Mom, can&#39;t I—&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;No, you can&#39;t. You&#39;re skating on thin ice as it is.&quot; Your mother watches $sibnick drag her feet out of the dining room, carrying the remains of her pot roast, until you finally hear her step on the stair treads and the sound of her bedroom door closing.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Something happened to day, Earl,&quot; Mom says slowly, pushing the remains of her pot roast around her plate with a fork. &quot;$name seems to have come down with something.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Polio?&quot; is Pop&#39;s immediate answer, making him look up from the newspaper.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;No. Not polio.&quot; Mom clears her throat delicately. &quot;It seems that, overnight, $name has turned into a $girlboy[$gen].&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Pop stares at her. &quot;You&#39;re kidding.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I&#39;m not, Earl, I&#39;m sorry,&quot; Mom says. &quot;$sibnick found out about it earlier today when she barged into $name&#39;s room. I&#39;ve already spoken to her about it. As soon as I found out, I called Dr Bennett to make an appointment. First thing Monday morning. And I&#39;ve made arrangements to call Mr Fordyce, the principal, before seven tonight.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;During dinner?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;It can&#39;t be helped. I haven&#39;t told him anything yet, but we&#39;ve got to let him know what our decision is.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;\
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Pop grunts, drumming his fingers on the newspaper underneath his right hand. &quot;We don&#39;t know what this condition thing is?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Dr Bennett thought he recognized it from some medical journal or other,&quot; Mom says. &quot;He says it&#39;s probably not contagious, so we don&#39;t need to worry about catching it.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Good to know,&quot; Pop says, his eyes widening a little. &quot;I hadn&#39;t thought of that. Well, what&#39;s left to decide, then?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;We have to decide what to do about school, if this doesn&#39;t wear off and $name is a $girlboy[$gen] for the rest of the year. What about clothing? What about scouts?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I don&#39;t think we should spend a lot of money on clothes.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I&#39;ve made a few calls to some of the other mothers in the PTA,&quot; Mom says. &quot;Families with $girlsboys[$gen], maybe a year or two older than $name. There&#39;s enough hand-me-downs out there, we&#39;ll be able to pick up some clothes tonight if we really need to.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You feel yourself turn a little pale at the idea of showing up to school tomorrow earing $girlboy[$oppgen] clothes.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Look at $acc[$oppgen],&quot; Pop says, glancing at you. &quot;$nomcap[$oppgen] looks like $nom[$oppgen]&#39;s going to be sick. Before you get too far ahead of yourself, maybe you should ask $name what //$nom[$oppgen]// wants.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;\
&lt;&lt;if $day == 3&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Throughout dinner, $sib keeps pestering you with questions about school. &lt;&lt;if $sex == &quot;male&quot;&gt;&gt;Did you have to go in the boys&#39; bathroom? Was it messy? Did you kiss any girls? Did any girls try to kiss you? Did you get kicked in the you-know-whats?&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;Did you have to go in the girls&#39; bathroom? Was it cleaner than the boys&#39; bathroom? Did you kiss any boys?

You&#39;re thinking about the afternoon spent upstairs in your room, necking with $so, and how exciting it was. Exciting, confusing — your head is in a tailspin.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Being a teenager was pretty tough. There&#39;s all these extra responsibilities, and you&#39;re growing out of your clothing like crazy, and you keep getting these crazy urges around &lt;&lt;if $sex == &quot;male&quot;&gt;&gt;girls&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;boys&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; that you can&#39;t really explain. Half the time you&#39;re &lt;&lt;if $sex == &quot;male&quot;&gt;&gt;doll dizzy, and you can&#39;t stop thinking about beautiful girls in your class,&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;khaki wacky, and you can&#39;t stop thinking about boys in your class,&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; and the other half of the time you wonder if you should //be// one of them. It&#39;s all so confusing, and you&#39;ve never mentioned it to anyone.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You try to put it out of your head as you get ready for bed: &lt;&lt;if $sex == &quot;male&quot;&gt;&gt;putting on your pajamas, brushing your teeth, combing your hair, and setting out your school clothes for the next day.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;putting on your nightgown, brushing your teeth, washing your face, brushing out your hair in the mirror, and setting out your school clothes for the next day.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

You have to face the chore of washing //this// face and brushing //these// teeth. You have to stare your new self in the mirror.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You really wish you could call $so and tell $acc[$sogen] about everything that&#39;s happened, but it&#39;s too late. Your parents don&#39;t approve of the use of the telephone after eight o&#39;clock. &quot;People are trying to sleep!&quot; Pop always says.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Never mind all that for now. Tomorrow is another day.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;&lt;if $day == 3&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;After dinner, you go about your evening bedtime routine, but even that isn&#39;t as peaceful as you&#39;d like. Mom keeps interrupting to make changes.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;if $cross == true&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;if $sex == &quot;male&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;You need to take a bath tonight,&quot; she says, passing by your door.

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;While you&#39;re scrubbing away, she leans halfway in the bathroom door — a nod toward privacy you&#39;ve rarely seen her afford you before — and drop something on the sink. &quot;Your father&#39;s Old Spice,&quot; she says. &quot;It&#39;ll help. I don&#39;t think you&#39;ve got any whiskers yet, but if you need a razor for your face I&#39;ll go shopping for something for you in the morning.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;elseif $sex == &quot;female&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;You should hop in the bath tonight,&quot; she says, passing by your door. &quot;I&#39;ll draw up the water for you, so it&#39;s nice and hot.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I don&#39;t need a bath until Saturday,&quot; you object.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Yes, you do,&quot; Mom says, and holds out something in her hand. It&#39;s short and pink, with a silver head. &quot;I got you a Kewtie razor at the store today, for your legs.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Mom, I //have// a razor.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;And you don&#39;t use it. It&#39;s rusty. This one is much better for legs. I&#39;ll show you how to use it. Come on, no questions now. Hop in the tub, let&#39;s go.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;And then, as you&#39;re halfway through your left leg, she pops right into the bathroom. While you&#39;re //naked.// She never used to do that.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Mom!&quot; you protest, dunking your legs under the water to hide your handiwork. Showing off shaved legs to your //mother// is mortifying.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;She puts some tins and tubs on the bathroom counter. &quot;This is for your underarms,&quot; she says, holding up a small tin. &quot;Madame Jones&#39; Body Sweet Deodorant. It&#39;ll make you smell nice. And this is Palmolive soap, it&#39;s good for your skin. And this is Pond&#39;s Cold Cream, it&#39;s for taking off your makeup. You don&#39;t want to get makeup all over your pillowcases; I just washed them. And don&#39;t do that in the tub.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;While you&#39;re scrubbing away, she leans halfway in the bathroom door — a nod toward privacy you&#39;ve rarely seen her afford you before. &quot;Do you want your father&#39;s Old Spice?&quot; she asks helpfully.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;No, Mom, I&#39;m trying to keep it a secret,&quot; you say. &quot;Everybody will notice if I go to school smelling like Old Spice.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;What about a razor for your face, then?&quot; she asks. &quot;You don&#39;t want to start getting whiskers.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Mom!&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Well, you don&#39;t,&quot; she says primly. &quot;I&#39;ll go shopping for something for you in the morning, then.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;elseif $sex == &quot;female&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;You should hop in the bath tonight,&quot; she says, passing by your door. &quot;I&#39;ll draw up the water for you, so it&#39;s nice and hot.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I don&#39;t need a bath until Saturday,&quot; you object.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Yes you do,&quot; she replies. &quot;No questions, now. Hop in, let&#39;s go.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;And then, as you&#39;re halfway through your bath, she pops right into the bathroom. While you&#39;re //naked.// She never used to do that.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Do you need any Palmolive or Ivory soap for your skin?&quot; she asks. &quot;That Kirk&#39;s Family Soap can dry out your skin.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I&#39;m trying to keep this all a secret, Mom,&quot; you protest. &quot;If I come to school with soft, girly skin, everybody&#39;s going to notice.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;She sniffs, as if to convey her disdain for the horrors of girls with dry skin, and leaves.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;In a few moment&#39;s she&#39;s back, asking if you want to try her shampoo.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Does it smell like flowers? Then no,&quot; you explain. &quot;Please, I&#39;m trying to have a bath.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&lt;&lt;if $sex == &quot;male&quot;&gt;&gt;At last you&#39;re able to get out of the tub and retreat to the bedroom, wearing a towel. It feels strange wearing the towel only around your waist, but there doesn&#39;t seem to be any point to wearing it up high. The towel swaddled on your head to dry your hair doesn&#39;t seem to be doing very much either.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;Even when you&#39;re able to get out of the tub, your mother pops into the bathroom to dress you in a towel. She insists on making you wear it all the way up to your nipples, because otherwise you don&#39;t look &quot;decent,&quot; according to her. &quot;And one for your hair, like this,&quot; she adds, swaddling your head in a second towel as you try to retreat to the bedroom.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

	+10 male, +10 female, every time player has sex.
	This is because sex is an in-between act for Zetas, and the player
	should be rewarded whether trying to get TO a particular sex, or
	have fun AS a particular sex.
	
	In theory, maximum possible is 100, but certain configurations can
	go up to 114 or so (mostly femininity). Adding in sex takes the
	max up to 140.

They think I&#39;m a //good// girl.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;You //are// a good girl,&quot; $so says. &quot;You&#39;re real swell. It&#39;s just awful tough for a guy, you know, when one minute you&#39;re kissing a gal, and the next minute you&#39;re real hard up.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I&#39;m sure it is,&quot; you say, a little indifferently. You&#39;d heard the term //blue balls// before but you&#39;d never admit in polite company that you knew what it meant. Maybe to your girlfriend $gf. Maybe.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Aw gee, $name, you don&#39;t know what it&#39;s like,&quot; $so says, squirming on the bed and trying to adjust his trousers.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Anyway,&quot; you go on, &quot;my kid sister $sibnick is a real pill. If she ever found out we were going steady, she&#39;d tattle on me in two shakes of lamb&#39;s tail. She loves getting me in dutch with the folks.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Can&#39;t we just make out a little while longer?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;You should know better by now,&quot; you say. &quot;Besides, it&#39;s almost five-thirty, and my pop is going to be home any minute. You better shake a leg.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;&lt;if $page == 1&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I don&#39;t care if you tell anyone we&#39;re going steady,&quot; you say. &quot;Just not Mom and Pop. They&#39;d flip their lids if they find out I&#39;m bringing a boy up to my room. They think I&#39;m a //good// girl.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;You //are// a good girl,&quot; $so says. &quot;You&#39;re real swell. It&#39;s just awful tough for a guy, you know, when one minute you&#39;re kissing a gal, and the next minute you&#39;re real hard up.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;&lt;if $page == 2&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You ask the operator for OLive-7076, and listen while the line rings. When $so&#39;s mother picks up, you ask to speak to him, and wait while she goes looking for him.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;He finally picks up. &quot;Hello?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;This is $name.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;if $openzeta == true&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;The line goes quiet for a moment, and then $so says, &quot;Is it?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Yes.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Are you sure? You didn&#39;t look like $name today in band class.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You are about to apologize, then you realize there&#39;s no reason for it. //You// didn&#39;t do anything wrong. &quot;Look, I know you must be upset,&quot; you say. &quot;But try to think about how //I// feel. Yesterday morning I came down with this very queer condition. It&#39;s not as if I //tried// to turn into a boy. That&#39;s just what happened.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Yeah, I reckon so,&quot; $so grumbles.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Anyway, I&#39;ve been thinking about it, and I bet I know how it happened. The other day after we were making out, remember? I had a strange dream that night, like you and I were about to go to bed together.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Oh?&quot; This perks him up.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Yes, and when I woke up, I was a boy,&quot; you explain. &quot;So I thought, what if we did it again? Would I go back to the way I was?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;set $path.push(&quot;SO informed&quot;)&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;What&#39;s up?&quot; $so asks.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Well,&quot; you begin slowly, &quot;don&#39;t flip out or anything, but you remember that day when we were making out?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Oh gee,&quot; he says instantly. &quot;You&#39;re not ... //pregnant//, are you?&quot; His voice dropped to a hush that was barely audible over the buzz of the phone line.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Nothing like that,&quot; you say with a nervous laugh. &quot;No, that night I had this strange dream, like we were about to //do// it, and when I woke up, I was a boy.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;There&#39;s a long silence on the other end.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;A boy?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Yeah,&quot; you say. &quot;It was very queer. &lt;&lt;if $path.includes(&quot;shameful TG&quot;)&gt;&gt;I had to stay home from school yesterday!&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;I had to go to school like that, if you can believe it!&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; And now I&#39;m &lt;&lt;if $newid == true&gt;&gt;having to pretend I&#39;m a cousin named $oppname $lastname.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;trying to keep anybody from finding out.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; It&#39;s most peculiar.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Yes, I can imagine,&quot; he says slowly. There&#39;s another pause, and he says, &quot;Are you pulling my leg?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I wish,&quot; you say. &quot;I could show you, if you don&#39;t believe me.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;No, you don&#39;t have to do that. I believe you.&quot; $so stops again to think. &quot;What kind of condition is this? Is there a cure?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I don&#39;t know yet. I did wonder if there&#39;s a way to change back. If the first change happened because we were making out, and then I had that dream, what would happen if we did that again? Would I go back to the way I was?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;\
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Hey, yeah,&quot; $so says, sudden excitement in his voice. &quot;That&#39;s true. Maybe it&#39;ll just go back to normal, yeah? Maybe it&#39;s just temporary.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;It could be,&quot; you say, although you don&#39;t want to get his -- or your -- hopes too high. &quot;It&#39;s worth a try. What do you think?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;There is a pause on the line. &quot;You&#39;re really a boy?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Just a little,&quot; you say. &quot;I didn&#39;t change much.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I suppose we can try it,&quot; $so says after another long pause. &quot;When?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Tomorrow night, maybe,&quot; you say. &quot;We can just pretend we&#39;re on a normal date. We go get ice cream or something, we go to the park, and we make out a little. Then if anything changes I&#39;ll tell you at school on Monday. No, wait, I have a doctor&#39;s appointment. I&#39;ll call you Monday night.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;All right, sure,&quot; he says, bemused. &quot;Sure, let&#39;s try it. To be honest, I&#39;m a little relieved.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Relieved? Why?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Summer was over and I thought //we// were over,&quot; he said. &quot;I thought I&#39;d done something wrong.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;No, nothing. It was just me.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I see that now. All right, it&#39;s a date. I&#39;ll see you tomorow at school.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;May I speak with $so, please?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Who is this?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;It&#39;s $currname,&quot; you explain.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;There&#39;s a long pause, and $so comes on the line. &quot;$currname!&quot; he says. &quot;Good, I&#39;m glad you called. I&#39;ve been worried about you.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Me too,&quot; you say, not sure which question you&#39;re agreeing to more. &quot;I thought we should probably talk.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I agree. You know, I&#39;ve been thinking about it, and it&#39;s really pretty keen what you&#39;re doing.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Is it?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Yeah,&quot; he says. &quot;And maybe I could, you know, lend a hand. Show you around, maybe.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I could use some more shoes.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;What&#39;s with you and shoes?&quot; he laughs, and for a moment, everything is just the way it&#39;s always been between you. You explain what a terrible few days you&#39;ve been having, all the confusion, the new classes, the extra attention, and $so seems to be right there with you, chuckling along at your stories.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You realize that you&#39;ve been dancing around the subject of your date with $fr and your fervent hopes that it&#39;ll change you back to normal. You haven&#39;t told $so about the date, and //technically// you suppose you&#39;re still going steady, even though you&#39;re both boys.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Something wrong?&quot; he asks. &quot;You&#39;ve gone quiet.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;What, you and $fr?&quot; he asks.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Or me and you.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Hmm,&quot; he says. &quot;Yeah, we might have to try that some time. I can&#39;t tomorrow, though. I just found out I have to get a new saxophone, and we&#39;re going shopping for one tomorrow.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Okay, yeah, some other time.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Yes,&quot; you say, &quot;but there&#39;s something I have to tell you first.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You reflect for a moment on how oblivious he is, and say, &quot;$fr had this idea that I should make out with //her.//&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Oh, uh-huh,&quot; $so says. &quot;Yeah, she&#39;s cute. I&#39;d go for it.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;You don&#39;t mind?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I kind of like the idea of you two making out,&quot; he says, a guilty tone creeping into his voice. &quot;I dunno. Anyway, it makes sense. If you and $fr go out, and you&#39;re dressed as a boy, nobody would notice anything unusual, right?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;And if you and I tried that, I&#39;d have to dress in my girl clothes,&quot; you conclude. &quot;And I don&#39;t look much like a girl.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Exactly. Besides, kissing girls is fun. You should get a chance to try it.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;It&#39;s not going to become a full-time hobby,&quot; you say. &quot;It&#39;s just an experiment.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Keen,&quot; $so says. &quot;Oh, hey, do you need anything? A jacket and tie, maybe? Some cologne?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Actually, yeah,&quot; you say. &quot;I don&#39;t have anything to wear.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;No problem. I got your six. Should I come over after school tomorrow and drop off some things?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;display &quot;CleanReturn&quot;&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;\
&lt;&lt;if $page == 8&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Well, maybe we could try another time,&quot; you suggest casually. &quot;You know, if I&#39;m still a boy in a few days.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Yeah, that&#39;s cool,&quot; $so says. &quot;Maybe after Monday you won&#39;t have to, though. Let me know how that goes.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;if $path.includes(&quot;friend date&quot;)&gt;&gt;Something occurs to you. &quot;Hey, I don&#39;t suppose I could borrow some clothes? And some shoes?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Yeah, I have lots,&quot; $so says. &lt;&lt;if $secret == true&gt;&gt;&quot;But aren&#39;t you trying to keep it a secret at school?&quot;&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;&quot;But don&#39;t you already have some?&quot;&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Just in case,&quot; you say &lt;&lt;if $secret == true&gt;&gt;lamely. &quot;You know, if my condition gets any worse and I can&#39;t go somewhere dressed as a girl.&quot;&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;lamely. &quot;I don&#39;t have all that much, and some of it&#39;s a little old.&quot;&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Good thinking,&quot; $so says. &quot;All right, I&#39;ll come over right after school and drop some stuff off.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I will. Talk to you later?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Definitely,&quot; he says. &quot;Good luck with school!&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;\
&lt;&lt;display &quot;CleanReturn&quot;&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;\
&lt;&lt;if $page == 9&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You eat dinner with $so at Ivar&#39;s Seafood, getting a couple orders of fish and chips — one cod, one halibut, with plenty of French fries to go around.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;It&#39;s a little awkward, sitting in the booth together, trying to make small talk. $so seems ill at ease.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You ask him what&#39;s bothering him, and he shrugs. &quot;It&#39;s so much easier to talk on the phone,&quot; he says. &quot;I know I say I don&#39;t much like the telephone, but there&#39;s a big difference between sitting at a table together and just //talking.// You stil sound the same, mostly. I guess that&#39;s what it is.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I&#39;m still the same person,&quot; you remind him.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I know,&quot; he says. &quot;And it&#39;s okay, because you&#39;re still ... still pretty good-looking, either way.&quot; $so drops his voice and looks around conspiratorally. &quot;I know guys aren&#39;t supposed to say that, but it&#39;s true.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Just treat me like I&#39;m still a girl, if you need to,&quot; you say. &quot;You know how to do that. After tonight, if this works, it&#39;ll all go back the way it was.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;After dinner, you take a walk to the park, and $so holds your hand. It seems smaller than before, or perhaps your hand is just bigger.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Should we try over there behind the bank, near the river?&quot; $so asks. &quot;It&#39;s out of sight.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;It&#39;s pretty out,&quot; you say. &quot;Let&#39;s just enjoy the sunlight for a bit.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Eventually, you make it to the riverbank. There are some footpaths here, and a few logs that have been worn down by a generation of people sitting on them and taking in the evening. $so slips his arm around you and holds you close, and you lean up against him. He smells like soap and Old Spice cologne, and he&#39;s trembling a little.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;It&#39;ll be okay,&quot; you assure him, patting his leg and squeezing his knee.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Yeah,&quot; $so says huskily. &quot;I know. I&#39;ve been looking forward to it, actually.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Then he&#39;s drawing you closer, turning you in his arms, and searching for your lips with his own. You let him kiss you, even as you hold him tight in your embrace and run your hands up and down his strong back. His breath is hot against your skin, your heart is pounding, and his kisses send you soaring.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;As he bestows your face and lips with kisses, and you return them, you can feel your cock beneath your skirt trying to stiffen. It&#39;s trying to break free of the concealing layers of clothing that you wrapped it in. There&#39;s a pleasant pressure as your cock struggles, but also pangs of discomfort as it strains against its confinement. Your cock is powerful and it //wants// something. You aren&#39;t even sure what, but just now you can&#39;t even remember what it was like being a girl.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Are you okay?&quot; he asks you, drawing back for a moment.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Amazing,&quot; you reply. &quot;You?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I can&#39;t believe I&#39;m kissing a boy,&quot; he murmurs. &quot;But it&#39;s ... it&#39;s not bad.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Is it like it was before?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Yeah,&quot; he says. &quot;Same blue balls, too.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;What are those?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;That&#39;s when your dick gets hard and you really want to do it,&quot; he says. &quot;But you can&#39;t.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;That&#39;s me, then,&quot; you say, turning a little pink. &quot;My dick is really hard.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Your—oh yeah,&quot; $so says, and grins. &quot;I forgot. You have one too.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Yep,&quot; you say, trying to adjust your skirts and your legs to give your stiffened cock a little more room. &quot;It&#39;s weird. Feels good, though.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;You know what else would—oh, never mind,&quot; $so says. &quot;Forget it.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;What? Something else that would feel good?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Oh, nothing,&quot; he says. &quot;You&#39;d probably worry about getting a reputation.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I don&#39;t think I //have// one any more,&quot; you say with a grin.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;He grins back, the light of sunset giving his face an orange glow. &quot;Then ... do you want to?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I&#39;m sure it is,&quot; she says with a smug little smile. What does //she// know about blue balls, anyhow?&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I&#39;m glad you think so,&quot; $so says with a smile, &quot;but we probably shouldn&#39;t spill the beans to your folks just yet. I bet they&#39;re going to flip their lids when they found out you&#39;re courting a young lady.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;She finally picks up. &quot;Hello?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Are you sure? You didn&#39;t look like $name today in Pep Squad.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;For some reason, you feel like you have to apologize. &quot;Look, I&#39;m very sorry, $so. I know you must be feeling upset, and I&#39;m sorry,&quot; you say. &quot;I wish it didn&#39;t have to be this way. Yesterday morning I came down with this very queer condition. I can&#39;t help it if I turned into a girl. That&#39;s just what happened.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Oh my,&quot; $so says, and her voice breaks. &quot;I&#39;m so sorry. You should have said.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I know. I should have called earlier, but it&#39;s been so crazy! But look, I&#39;ve been thinking about it, and I feel sure I know how it happened. The other day, after we made out, I had a strange dream that night. You and I were about to go to bed together.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Ooh, tell me more.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;That&#39;s just it. Nothing happened in the dream. And when I woke up, I was a girl,&quot; you explain. &quot;So I thought, maybe I&#39;ll change back to the way I was if we do it again.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;set $path.push(&quot;SO informed&quot;)&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;What is it?&quot; $so asks.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Well,&quot; you begin slowly, &quot;don&#39;t flip out or anything, but you remember that day when we were making out?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;$name!&quot; she says, in an amused, mock-scandalized voice. &quot;I&#39;m a good girl. I would //never// do that.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Surely not,&quot; you grin. &quot;Anyway, that night I had this strange dream, like we were about to //do// it, and when I woke up, I was a girl.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;There&#39;s a long silence on the other end.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;A girl? Really?&quot; she asks. &quot;In your dream?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;In my actual bed,&quot; you say. &quot;I thought I&#39;d gone nuts. &lt;&lt;if $path.includes(&quot;shameful TG&quot;)&gt;&gt;So I stayed home from school! What else could I do?&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;And I had to go to school like that, because what else could I do?&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; And now I&#39;m &lt;&lt;if $newid == true&gt;&gt;having to pretend I&#39;m a cousin named $oppname $lastname.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;trying to keep anybody from finding out.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; It&#39;s been a strange few days, I tell you.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I&#39;m sure it would be,&quot; she says, with great sympathy. Her voice takes on a sterner note. &quot;You&#39;d better not be pulling some prank on me. You&#39;re serious? Cross your heart?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;And hope to die. I could show you, if you want.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;No, you don&#39;t have to do that. I believe you.&quot; $so stops again to think. &quot;What kind of condition is this? Is there a cure?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I don&#39;t know yet. I did wonder if there&#39;s a way to change back. If the first change happened because we were making out, and then I had that dream, what would happen if we did that again? Would I go back to the way I was?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;\
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Oh, that&#39;s a thought,&quot; $so says, intrigued. &quot;That&#39;s a very good point. You might just go back to normal. We don&#39;t know why you changed, do we? It could be anything.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;It could be,&quot; you say, although you don&#39;t want to get her -- or your -- hopes too high. &quot;It&#39;s worth a try. What do you think?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;There is a pause on the line. &quot;You&#39;re really a girl?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Just a little,&quot; you say. &quot;I didn&#39;t change much.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Then I suppose we could give it a try,&quot; $so says after another long pause. &quot;When?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Tomorrow night, maybe,&quot; you say. &quot;We can just pretend we&#39;re on a normal date. We go get ice cream or something, we go to the park, and we make out a little. Then if anything changes I&#39;ll tell you at school on Monday. No, wait, I have a doctor&#39;s appointment. I&#39;ll call you Monday night.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Perfect,&quot; she says. &quot;I can&#39;t wait!&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Really? Why?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I always like seeing you,&quot; $so says happily. &quot;Even if you&#39;re not exactly you right now. I could get used to you like this. Not for — not for getting //married,//&quot; she adds. &quot;But you know. A girl doesn&#39;t //always// have to do that these days.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I suppose you&#39;re right.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I&#39;m always right. Anyway, take care. I&#39;ll see you tomorow at school.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;How?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;You get to see what it&#39;s like, being a girl. I mean, who gets to do that? Other than girls. And maybe I could, you know, lend a hand. You probably have a lot of questions about, I don&#39;t know, clothes or makeup. Speaking of which, do you need any? Is there something you want to borrow?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I could use some more shoes.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;She just laughs. &quot;I told you!

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;It&#39;s $currname,&quot; you explain.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;There&#39;s a long pause, and $so comes on the line. &quot;$currname!&quot; she says. &quot;Good, I&#39;m glad you called. I&#39;ve been worried sick about you.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I&#39;ve been worried sick about me, too,&quot; you say. &quot;I was hoping we could talk more about ... everything.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Oh, thanks, because I feel the same way. You know, I&#39;ve been going over the whole thing in my mind, and actually I&#39;m starting to really like what&#39;s happened. It&#39;s pretty keen, what you&#39;re doing.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;How?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;You get to see what it&#39;s like, being a girl. I mean, who gets to do that? Other than girls. And maybe I could, you know, lend a hand. You probably have a lot of questions about, I don&#39;t know, clothes or makeup. Speaking of which, do you need any? Is there something you want to borrow?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I could use some more shoes.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;She just laughs. &quot;I told you! I told you that shoes were important, and now you finally know!&quot; You laugh in response, and for a moment, everything is just the way it&#39;s always been between you. You explain what a terrible few days you&#39;ve been having, all the confusion, the new classes, the extra attention, and $so seems to be right there with you, giggling along at your stories.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You realize you&#39;ve been dancing around the subject of $fr&#39;s idea of trying to change back to normal, and decide to mention it. &quot;I don&#39;t know if it&#39;ll work,&quot; you say, &quot;but it&#39;s worth a try.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;What, you and $fr?&quot; she asks. &quot;Part of me wants to know why you&#39;re making out with someone other than me. But the other part of me thinks that&#39;d be kind of cute.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;It could also be me and you.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Fair point,&quot; she says. &quot;If it would help you change back to normal, I&#39;m willing to do anything. You know that. It&#39;s just tomorrow that I can&#39;t. I just found out I have to sign up for dance lessons, and tomorrow night is the deadline.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;All right, some other time.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You say your goodbyes and hang up.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Hello?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;May I speak with $so, please?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Who is this?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;It&#39;s $currname,&quot; you explain.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;There&#39;s a long pause, and $so comes on the line. &quot;name!&quot; she says. &quot;Good, I&#39;m glad you called. I noticed you were having a little trouble with some of the warm-up stretches, and I thought maybe I could help you with them. Is that what you were calling for? To ask me for help?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Sort of,&quot; you say. &quot;It&#39;s not class. It&#39;s something else.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;What is it?&quot; $so asks.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Well,&quot; you begin slowly, &quot;don&#39;t flip out or anything, but you remember that day when we were making out?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;$name!&quot; she says, in an amused, mock-scandalized voice. &quot;I&#39;m a good girl. I would //never// do that.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Surely not,&quot; you grin. &quot;Anyway, that night I had this strange dream, like we were about to //do// it, and when I woke up, I was a girl.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;There&#39;s a long silence on the other end.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;A girl? Really?&quot; she asks. &quot;In your dream?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;In my actual bed,&quot; you say. &quot;I thought I&#39;d gone nuts. &lt;&lt;if $path.includes(&quot;shameful TG&quot;)&gt;&gt;So I stayed home from school! What else could I do?&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;And I had to go to school like that, because what else could I do?&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; And now I&#39;m trying to keep anybody from finding out. That&#39;s why I had to get out of gym class and do Pep Squad. It&#39;s been a strange few days, I tell you.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I&#39;m sure it would be,&quot; she says, with great sympathy. &quot;What kind of condition is this? Is there a cure?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I don&#39;t know yet. I did wonder if there&#39;s a way to change back. If the first change happened because we were making out, and then I had that dream, what would happen if we did that again? Would I go back to the way I was?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Oh, that&#39;s a thought,&quot; $so says, intrigued. &quot;That&#39;s a very good point. You might just go back to normal. We don&#39;t know why you changed, do we? It could be anything.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;You think it would work?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;You never know,&quot; she says. &quot;Maybe we could try tomorrow night — no, wait, Mom is taking me shopping for new shoes tomorrow. I need them for Pep Squad. Mine are all worn out.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Um, not really. That&#39;s what I&#39;m calling about.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Her voice goes quiet. &quot;You know you can tell me anything.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;&lt;if $page == 7&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Actually, I&#39;ve already got a plan,&quot; you explain.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;&lt;set $path.push(&quot;SO helping on date&quot;)&gt;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;A plan for what?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;On how to change back.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;It&#39;s a little alarming how quickly her mind leaps to the correct conclusion. &quot;You&#39;re going on a date with someone else, aren&#39;t you?&quot; she asks, raising her voice. &quot;I can&#39;t believe it. Who is it? Is it $fr?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; you say immediately. &quot;It was his idea. And I thought it would be a lot easier to try making out with a boy, because I already //look// like a girl, mostly. If anyone saw //us// hanging out together or making out, they might think //you// liked kissing girls, and I know you don&#39;t want to get a bad reputation.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I suppose you&#39;re right,&quot; $so says, and retreats back to her normal voice almost as quickly as she had raised it. &quot;That&#39;s very sensible, really. I&#39;m still upset with you, though, $so.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I&#39;m sorry, I didn&#39;t mean to upset you.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I&#39;m not upset,&quot; she insists. &quot;I&#39;m a little confused. But I know you must be //twice// as confused. I shouldn&#39;t take it out on you. Part of me is jealous that you&#39;re making out with somebody else, but part of me thinks you and $fr would be kind of cute together.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I&#39;m not going //out// with him,&quot; you say. &quot;It&#39;s just an experiment.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;You&#39;ll have to tell me how it goes,&quot; $so says. &quot;Do you need anything? Any clothes? A cute dress? I can help you with that.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Um, yeah,&quot; you say. &quot;I don&#39;t have anything to wear.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Well, let //me// take care of that,&quot; $so says happily. &quot;When is your date? Tomorrow? I&#39;ll come over after school. I can&#39;t stay long, but I can get you set up.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;display &quot;CleanReturn&quot;&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;\
&lt;&lt;if $page == 8&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Well, maybe we could try another time,&quot; you suggest casually. &quot;You know, if I&#39;m still a girl in a few days.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;That&#39;s a good idea,&quot; $so says. &quot;Let me know what the doctor says on Monday, okay?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;if $path.includes(&quot;friend date&quot;)&gt;&gt;Something occurs to you. &quot;Hey, I don&#39;t suppose I could borrow some clothes? And some shoes?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Whatever you need,&quot; $so says. &lt;&lt;if $secret == true&gt;&gt;&quot;But why? I thought you were trying to keep it a secret at school.&quot;&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;&quot;But why? Didn&#39;t you already find some?&quot;&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Just in case,&quot; you say &lt;&lt;if $secret == true&gt;&gt;lamely. &quot;You know, if my condition gets any worse and I can&#39;t go somewhere dressed as a boy.&quot;&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;lamely. &quot;You can never have too many clothes.&quot;&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;That&#39;s true,&quot; $so says. &quot;All right, I&#39;ll come over right after school with some clothes you can wear. I can&#39;t stay long, but I can get you set up.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I will,&quot; you promise her. &quot;Talk to you later?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Definitely,&quot; she says. &quot;Good luck with school!&quot;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;He brushes you off with some talk about an outbreak in South Dakota or North Carolina or someplace &quot;back East,&quot; as he calls anything on the other side of the Rocky Mountains. But Mom interrupts with a look of concern. &quot;Earl, don&#39;t you think we should tell the kids, if it&#39;s something they need to be on the lookout for?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Pop sighs and says, &quot;Just an article I saw in the paper. A woman flew up from California to be with her son before ... before the end. But polio got the little boy first.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Oh, dear,&quot; says Mom, clutching her throat.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Yes, I know,&quot; Pop says, sighing again. &quot;When are they finally going to lick this thing, that&#39;s what I want to know. They&#39;ve been working on that vaccine for, what? Ten years now? Eleven?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Seventeen,&quot; says Mom, glancing at you. &quot;I remember, because it was right before we got married and had $name. They had this doctor come to our school when I was a senior. Part of a vaccination trial. It didn&#39;t work, of course. A couple of the volunteers got polio anyway. And some of them had //kids// who got it. But they&#39;re working very hard, I&#39;m sure.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Pop rolls his eyes. &quot;Oh, yes, I&#39;m sure. Taking their sweet time, that&#39;s what I call it. I&#39;m telling you, we never would have taken this long in the Army. We&#39;d have gone in and got the job //done.// No nonsense, no sir.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Yes, dear.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Speaking of getting the job done,&quot; Pop says, putting down his fork. Pop never put down his fork at the dinner table unless he meant business. &quot;It&#39;s starting to look like rain next week, so I&#39;ve got to put in that new fence. This weekend, if I can, so I&#39;m going to have to really push hard to finish up. &lt;&lt;if $sex == &quot;male&quot;&gt;&gt;I&#39;ll need $name out back, helping me load and unload.

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Okay, Sunday, then,&quot; your father says.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Whatever you need, Daddy,&quot; you say. Giving up one of your weekend days isn&#39;t bad. At least if you&#39;re helping Pop on Sunday, you&#39;ll have some of Saturday free to go to the movies with $gf.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;&lt;if $sex == &quot;male&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;You&#39;re a girl, $sibnick dear,&quot; Mom says. &quot;Besides, I&#39;ll need your help with the vacuuming and the dusting inside.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Daddy&#39;s tools are too dangerous for girls, pumpkin,&quot; Pop says to her. &quot;I don&#39;t want you getting hurt.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;But //she&#39;s// allowed to help,&quot; $sibnick whines, pointing to you.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;She&#39;s older,&quot; Mom says. &quot;Besides, I&#39;ll need your help with the vacuuming and the dusting inside.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I suppose,&quot; $sib grumbles.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;&lt;if $page == 6&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Mom!&quot; you shout out into the hallway. &quot;Can you come here?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;&lt;set $newknowns to [30]&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;display &quot;NewKnowns&quot;&gt;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Mother comes into the upstairs hallway with an armload of sheets for the laundry. &lt;&lt;if $startsex == &quot;male&quot;&gt;&gt;&quot;Please don&#39;t shout at me across the house,&quot;&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;&quot;It&#39;s not ladylike to shout across the house, dear,&quot;&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; she says. &quot;What is it? Is the hot water not working again?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;No, it&#39;s — it&#39;s something weird,&quot; you say, and you &lt;&lt;if $startsex == &quot;male&quot;&gt;&gt;pull down your pajamas a little&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;lift up your nightgown a little&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; to show her what you mean.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Well, that&#39;s—&quot; she begins, and stops. &quot;My goodness! What happened? Did — did Dr Bennett make a mistake when you were—? But no, I used to change you when you were little, and — Earl!&quot; She stops rambling and calls for Pop. &quot;Earl, come here!&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Not Pop, please,&quot; you beg her. Even your voice sounds a little different. Not much, but a little &lt;&lt;if $startsex == &quot;male&quot;&gt;&gt;higher&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;deeper&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; than yesterday.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Very well, cover yourself up,&quot; Mom says, fretting. &quot;But I think you need to see a doctor right away.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;When Pop arrives, Mom has to tell him the whole thing, including her muddled half of the conversation, in excruciating detail while you stand in the bathroom turning redder and redder. At last, Pop says, &quot;Why didn&#39;t you say anything sooner?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;It just happened, Pop,&quot; you say. &quot;This morning. Or maybe last night. I had a really weird dream, and I woke up like this. I — I&#39;m not exactly sure //when// it happened.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;What did you dream about?&quot; Mom asks.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I don&#39;t remember,&quot; you say uncomfortably. &quot;It was just a dream, honestly.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;She stares at you for a moment, clucking her tongue. &quot;I guess there&#39;s nothing we can do about it right now,&quot; she says. &quot;You&#39;ll just have to go to school like that. I&#39;ll call Dr Bennett and make an appointment for you as soon as possible.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;display &quot;CleanReturn&quot;&gt;&gt;

You&#39;re not even sure you can face your friends at school like this. What if somebody found out?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;When you&#39;ve had a moment to use the toilet — an all-new experience you&#39;re not likely to forget in a hurry — you scuttle back to your bedroom, hop in bed, and pull the blankets up to your nose. Eventually Mom passes your bedroom door with an armful of laundry and knocks one-handed. &quot;$name, time to get up for school.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I don&#39;t feel well this morning,&quot; you moan, trying to sound extra pathetic. Your voice seems a little different — not much, just a little &lt;&lt;if $startsex == &quot;male&quot;&gt;&gt;higher&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;deeper&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; than yesterday. &quot;I don&#39;t think I can go.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Oh, dear,&quot; Mom says. You hardly //ever// stay home sick from school, good scout-in-training that you are. &quot;I&#39;ll take your temperature and call the doctor.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;It&#39;s my stomach,&quot; you say, hoping to put off the dreaded Clifton glass thermometer your mom bought at Rexall Drug all those years ago. It took //eons// to read properly.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;We&#39;ll see,&quot; was her answer.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Of course, there was no fever, but she insisted on calling Dr Bennett anyway. The doctor must not have said anything conclusive, because Mom let you stay in bed. &quot;You&#39;d better go downstairs and telephone one of your friends and ask them to bring your homework over for you. I&#39;ll make chicken soup for lunch,&quot; she offers. &quot;That should settle your stomach. If that doesn&#39;t help, I&#39;ll bring up some castor oil.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Chicken soup, castor oil and the Clifton thermometer: Mom&#39;s solution for everything. But at least she&#39;s likely to leave you alone up in your room, mostly, while you sort out what to do about all ... all this.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;\
&lt;&lt;if $page == 8&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You&#39;re barely out the door before Mom is climbing the stairs, her footfalls thumping on each step with the tread of approaching doom.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;All right, $name, what&#39;s all this?&quot; Mom asks sternly, with $sibnick hiding behind Mom&#39;s skirts with a look of devilish glee. &quot;$sib just came downstairs with some wild story, and I want to know what you&#39;ve been telling her.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;She&#39;s just trying to get me grounded, that&#39;s all,&quot; you protest. It&#39;s a little white lie, perhaps, but it&#39;s got some truth to it.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Is this true, $sib?&quot; she demands. &quot;Are you telling stories?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;No, mama, I //saw// it,&quot; she says plaintively.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;And why were you able to see it?&quot; Mom asks in a shrewd voice. &quot;Why was $sibnick able to see anything at all? Were you showing it to $fr upstairs in your room? Were you thinking about playing Doctor with your little friend?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Mom, I wasn&#39;t playing Doctor!&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Then you&#39;d better have a good explanation why you had your underpants down when your sister came into the room,&quot; Mom says. &quot;Why don&#39;t you tell me what that explanation is, hmm?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
--[[explain it to her|1948 Family Talk][$path.push(&quot;Dot tattled&quot;), $page to 9]]
&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;\
&lt;&lt;if $page == 9&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You don&#39;t have much of a choice. It&#39;s either admit to your mother that something strange happened last night, and you were asking $fr what to do, or allow $sib&#39;s falsehood to remain standing and permit Mom to think you were playing Doctor with another $girlboy[$fgen]. Increasingly it strikes you that the word &quot;another&quot; no longer applies, but you can&#39;t decide if that&#39;s worse or better, trouble-wise.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;So you explain the whole thing, and you let Mom see what happened to you overnight.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Hmmm,&quot; she says, her mouth a thin line. &quot;That&#39;s unusual. All right, I suppose I can understand why you were showing it to your friend, but honey, why didn&#39;t you tell //us?// &lt;&lt;if $path.includes(&quot;shameful TG&quot;)&gt;&gt;If you had to stay home from school because of this, then I wish you would have told me the reason why.

That&#39;s what family is //for.// Now first thing, we really need to call Dr Bennett and tell him what happened.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; And of course we&#39;ll have to tell the school. I&#39;m sure I have Mr Fordyce&#39;s number around here somewhere. He&#39;s still the principal, right?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Do we have to tell everybody?&quot; you ask.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Yes. We&#39;ll discuss it tonight over dinner,&quot; Mom says with finality. &quot;When your father gets home. I&#39;m sure that&#39;s what he&#39;s going to decide.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;And as for you, little lady,&quot; Mom says to $sibnick, grabbing her skinny arm sharply, &quot;you don&#39;t go barging in on people when they have the door closed. That&#39;s very rude. I&#39;ll be sure to tell your father about that, too.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;The look of evil triumph on $sibnick&#39;s face fades a little.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;\
&lt;&lt;if $page == 10&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I think we should tell the school what happened,&quot; you say, a little bit of the &lt;&lt;if $startsex == &quot;male&quot;&gt;&gt;Boy&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;Girl&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; Scout honesty rising in you. &quot;They&#39;re going to have to know eventually. Maybe they could help us.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;That&#39;s a good idea,&quot; Pop says. &quot;What kind of help did you have in mind?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Well, you know,&quot; you say, guessing aloud. &quot;If we tell them what happened, maybe I don&#39;t have to do gym class with the rest of the $girlsboys[$oppgen]. I could do something else instead. Or maybe they&#39;d led me go to the school as a $girlboy[$gen] until it ... it, you know, I stop being one. I mean, it&#39;s not //my// fault this happened, right? They can&#39;t get too mad at me.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Let a $girlboy[$oppgen] into the school wearing $girlboy[$gen] clothes?&quot; Pop asks suspiciously. &quot;Gym classes and everything?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;We&#39;d write the school a note about gym class,&quot; Mom says. &quot;If they would accept that.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;And if they don&#39;t?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Maybe we ask the school to enroll $name under some other name, like &lt;&lt;if $startsex == &quot;male&quot;&gt;&gt;$fchoice.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;$mchoice.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; We could say $nom[$gen]&#39;s a cousin that&#39;s staying with us, and maybe the school would play along.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;

Oh, the teasing you&#39;d get! &quot;I don&#39;t think they&#39;d be very good at keeping all this a secret. They&#39;d have to tell all my teachers, and the school nurse, and somebody could find out, and then I&#39;d have to run off and join a freakshow or something.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;That&#39;s a good point,&quot; Pop says. &quot;People can be cruel. So what did you have in mind instead?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; you say, trying to pin down your thoughts. &quot;Maybe we just don&#39;t tell them anything? Write me a note to get out of gym class, and maybe that&#39;s enough. By Monday I could be completely back to normal, don&#39;t you think?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Mom gives you a melancholy smile. &quot;We can always hope so.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;And if $nom[$oppgen] isn&#39;t?&quot; Pop asks bluntly.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;We could tell the school that $name is called, I don&#39;t know, &lt;&lt;if $startsex == &quot;female&quot;&gt;&gt;$fchoice&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;$mchoice&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; or something, a distant cousin who&#39;s staying with us,&quot; Mom suggests. &quot;We&#39;ll say the real $name has taken ill, and could they please send the homework home. Then you&#39;ll just do the work for both sets of classes.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Why both?&quot; you ask.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;In case it //doesn&#39;t// go back to normal,&quot; Mom says with a simple shrug. &quot;You still want to graduate high school, don&#39;t you?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;And you&#39;ll pick up clothes tonight?&quot; Pop asks.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I made some calls,&quot; Mom promises. &quot;Some of the PTA mothers have some hand-me-downs we can have. If you take your car and I take mine, we&#39;ll cover a lot more ground. Do you mind?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;No, no,&quot; Pop says, pushing himself away from the table. &quot;Let&#39;s get going. $name, you should start getting ready for bed.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;elseif $path.includes(&quot;pussyboy schedule&quot;) or $path.includes(&quot;dickgirl schedule&quot;)&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;All right,&quot; Mom says, hanging up the phone with a clatter. &quot;It took a little convincing, but Mr Fordyce has agreed to let you attend school under your own name. I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s a good idea, myself, because I&#39;m //sure// those bullies at school are going to tease you when they find out about your ... your condition.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;What about clothes?&quot; Pop asks.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Oh, that&#39;s right,&quot; Mom says. &quot;I almost forgot. Mr Fordyce says you have to stick to the school dress code for $girlsboys[$gen]. If you switch back, then you stick to the dress code for $girlsboys[$oppgen] again. I&#39;ll write you a note to get you out of the regular gym class and into something else.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I can&#39;t just skip gym?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;No, it&#39;s required for all students, unless there&#39;s some reason they can&#39;t,&quot; Mom says.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;And you can,&quot; Pop says firmly. &quot;Look at you, you have two legs, two arms. There&#39;s got to be something you can do. I know guys who came back from the war who&#39;d //love// to have their arms and legs. You&#39;re not skipping gym, no sir.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;And I agree with your father,&quot; Mom says. &quot;All right, Earl, if you and I each take our cars, we&#39;ll be able to drive around and pick up some clothes. I made a few calls. Some of the mothers in the PTA have hand-me-downs we can have. $name, you&#39;d better start getting ready for bed.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;elseif $path.includes(&quot;secret girl schedule&quot;) or $path.includes(&quot;secret boy schedule&quot;)&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;All right, I think we&#39;re all settled,&quot; Mom says, hanging up the phone with a clatter. &quot;I didn&#39;t tell Mr Fordyce about your ... your condition. I just said you have to be excused from regular gym class for the rest of the year. They&#39;ll put you in an independent study program so you still get your exercise, but not with the other kids in your class.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Thanks, Mom.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;With a little bit of luck,&quot; Mom goes on, &quot;on Monday when we see Dr Bennett, he&#39;ll have a nice little remedy for you, and this will be all over soon.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I sure hope so.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Me too, honey. All right, it&#39;s been a long day. You&#39;d better start getting ready for bed.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;\
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;All right,&quot; you say, standing and picking up your plate.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Leave it,&quot; Mom tells you. &quot;You&#39;ve had quite a scare today. I&#39;ll make $sib help wash the dishes tonight. $sibnick!&quot; she calls toward the stairs. &quot;Yes, I hear you, eavesdropping. Not very clever, little missy. You get in here and start clearing the table. You&#39;ve got dishes to do.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;display &quot;CleanReturn&quot;&gt;&gt;

&lt;&lt;if $page == 13&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;if $path.includes(&quot;secret from scouts&quot;)&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;All right, then,&quot; Mom says, &quot;but when we talk to Dr Bennett on Monday, we&#39;re going to get a note or something. I don&#39;t like the idea of just hiding it from your scoutmaster. If you get caught, you could get kicked out of the scouts.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;That&#39;s something to mull over while &lt;&lt;if $startsex == &quot;male&quot;&gt;&gt;you&#39;re helping $sibnick do the dishes. You&#39;ve never had to do the dishes before; it always fell to your sister. Now that you&#39;re a girl, you suppose Mom thinks you ought to learn how. Are you going to have to learn how to be a Girl Scout now?&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;$sibnick is clearing the table by herself, and you&#39;re taking out the trash. Mom always made you girls do the dishes together. Now that you&#39;re a boy, $sib is doing them all by herself, and you&#39;re doing other chores. Dad figured it was time you started learning how. Are you going to have to learn how to be a Boy Scout, too?&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;elseif $path.includes(&quot;tell scouts&quot;)&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;You can call $scout after dinner,&quot; Mom decides. &quot;Eat up first, &lt;&lt;if $startsex == &quot;male&quot;&gt;&gt;help $sibnick with the dishes, and then you can make your call.&quot;&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;and you can make your call while $sibnick does the dishes.&quot;&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You try to explain the whole thing to $scout, but it&#39;s not easy over the phone. You get the distinct idea that $scout isn&#39;t really taking it all in.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Come to the meeting tomorrow and we can talk about it,&quot; $nom[$oppsex] says. &quot;We&#39;ll get it sorted out.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;That sounded a bit ominous. What happens if $scout decides you have to quit the scouts? Rules are rules, after all.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;elseif $path.includes(&quot;skip scouts&quot;)&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;You should call $scout after dinner and let $acc[$oppgen] know,&quot; Mom decides. &quot;Eat up first, &lt;&lt;if $startsex == &quot;male&quot;&gt;&gt;help $sibnick with the dishes, and then you can make your call.&quot;&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;and you can make your call while $sibnick does the dishes.&quot;&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You feel a bit guilty about having to lie to $scout, but there&#39;s nothing else you can do. Anyway, it&#39;s just one meeting.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;One meeting ... if Dr Bennett is able to give you a cure on Monday. That&#39;s a pretty big if.&lt;/div&gt;

The attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941 interrupted a decades-long progressive education movement emphasizing science, engineering, and math, and which focused on critical analysis of American institutions. After Pearl Harbor, when fear and paranoia set in, such progressive notions were scrapped in favor of the &quot;lifestyle adjustment curriculum.&quot;

This was designed to teach life skills to the 60% of students who would not go on to post-secondary education. About 30% of students would graduate, and there were plenty of jobs available for this level of education. It proposed to teach American students to be good, patriotic (and pliable) citizens, claiming that the old progressive education taught children to be materialistic and gave them bankrupt morals. The &quot;lifestyle&quot; curriculum was criticized (at the time, and also later) for being too soft and non-academic, emphasizing daily life skills (like literacy) over rigorous study (like understanding and questioning what you read).

Part of the reason for this focus was a renewed interest in integrating American education with national defense priorities. While recruiting soldiers for World War II, the Army had to reject hundreds of thousands of applicants for being illiterate. They also discovered how disorganized and non-standardized the curriculum could be across various states; the quality of education varied widely. There was also a shortage of people skilled in modern foreign languages.

Homework was fairly unknown, especially at lower age levels; most high school students had less than 2 hours per evening. When the Soviets launched Sputnik in 1957 it forced a massive re-think of education in America vis-a-vis national defense priorities, and the burden of nightly homework began to ramp skyward.

Courses: reading, grammar, written and mental arithmetic, social studies, science, family life, hygiene, health, religion, speech. Geography (maps), languages, gym, home economics, biology, shop (&quot;industrial arts&quot;). Photography.

There would also be an emphasis on geography (especially map familiarity). Biology and home ec courses would start to teach first aid and nursing. During the war, schools would hold drives for paper and scrap metal. Intra-varsity athletics were emphasized, along with calisthenics drills, to increase student health in the event of national need. Social Studies courses focused on problems that related directly to national welfare -- unlike before the war, when the courses focused on critical problems within the US. (Our player in 1948 would have seen both of these techniques.)

Note: up until 1970 or so, it was common for boys to swim naked in gym class; suits &quot;of the simplest type&quot; were mandatory for girls. This is a fascinating sidelight into education in the 1940s, so I&#39;ll use it.

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;You will select some suitable classmates,&quot; Mrs Hull says in that precise, mannered way of hers, &quot;and perform for the class a short scene from the play. Get out your pencils, and I will read you the list of approved scenes.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Everyone in the class dutifully copies down the list.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Each scene may be performed by only one group,&quot; Mrs Hull continues. &quot;That way, we will cover most of the important parts of the play. You may find that there are more parts for men than for women. If that is the case, and your group does not have enough boys, girls are permitted to read the boys&#39; parts, or boys to read girls&#39; parts, if it must come to that.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Around you, your classmates exchange embarrassed titters. Nobody wants to be //that// unfortunate soul, who has to read a part for the opposite sex. They have //no// idea what that would be really like, you decide.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Then, naturally, $eng has to go and announce your presence to the entire class, and your anonymity is gone forever.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I require your attention, class,&quot; $eng says coolly. &quot;Endeavor to calm yourselves.&quot; She adjusts her spectacles and peers at a note on her clipboard. &quot;I understand we have a student in our class who has come down with ... a peculiar condition. If you have not been assiduously following the news, you may be unaware of it, but we now have a student among us who is afflicted by it, so we must strive to treat the situation with grace.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;She gestures toward you. &quot;$name $lastname, as you can see, has contracted a condition that has caused $acc[$oppgen] to become a $girlboy[$oppgen]. It is a rare disease that is not yet fully understood, but it is not, as far as we know, contagious, so there is no imminent peril that any of //you// will contract it also.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;An interested murmur goes around the class as people inspect you carefully.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;You must understand that this is a medical syndrome,&quot; $eng continues in that cool, detached way of hers. &quot;This is neither $acc[$oppgen] fault, nor should we assume it is $acc[$oppgen] choice. The rest of us must therefore be as accommodating as we can. Meanwhile, $currname is expected to adhere to all the usual rules and dress codes as any other $girlboy[$gen] in the school. Is that clear?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Her look is so stern and unforgiving that it is a few moments before any student dares raise their hand. One girl says, &quot;Is $nom[$gen] going to be reading a boy&#39;s part or a girl&#39;s part?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;A $girlboy[$gen]&#39;s part, of course,&quot; $eng says, &quot;just the same as anyone else. Unless there are not enough $girlsboys[$oppgen] to go around. Now, in reference to your assignment: you will be forming reading groups on Friday, so start thinking about whom you would select to partner with...&quot; and she&#39;s off the subject of your strange transformation and onto ordinary class business.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I require your attention, class,&quot; $eng says coolly. &quot;Endeavor to calm yourselves.&quot; She adjusts her spectacles and peers at a note on her clipboard. &quot;We have a new student among us.

If you would like to take a seat there near the window, that would be better. Thank you.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You have to shuffle your books and things to the other desk. Of //course// that&#39;s not your seat any more. You should have remembered.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;You wouldn&#39;t happen to know where $name is today, would you?&quot; $eng asks, checking her roll list.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;No, ma&#39;am, I don&#39;t,&quot; you say, as truthfully as you can.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Very well. I assume you do not object to taking $poss[$oppgen] homework to $acc[$oppgen].&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;No, ma&#39;am.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Good. You will find a copy of //As You Like It// on the table in the back of class. Please select one and return to your seat. Before we get to the assigned reading, class, let&#39;s discuss your reading groups.

&lt;&lt;elseif $secret == true&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You slip into class without drawing any attention to yourself. Nobody seems to notice anything unusual. They all still seem to think you&#39;re just an ordinary $girlboy[$oppgen].&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;$eng takes roll, looking over all the students&#39; faces in their assigned seats and trying to recall each name. When she comes to you, she pauses before recalling your name.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;//She didn&#39;t notice anything, did she?// you wonder. //How could she? I&#39;m the same as I was yesterday, right?//&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Then she&#39;s speaking. &quot;I require your attention, class. Endeavor to calm yourselves. Before we begin with the assigned reading from last night, permit me to remind you that your groups will be signing up for your scene selections on Friday.

&lt;&lt;set $newknowns to [8, 23, 27]&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;display &quot;NewKnowns&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;She then turns to the first act of the play. &quot;You may have had some difficulty at first with Shakespeare&#39;s use of language and meter,&quot; she explains, &quot;but I assure you that, with sufficient practice, it will become almost second nature to you. Now: who can tell me the two main characters of Act One?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Orlando?&quot; asks Doris Thacker, a cute brunette.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Yes, Orlando is one,&quot; $eng replies. &quot;Orlando has been ill-treated at the hands of his cruel brother, Oliver, who has denied Orlando the education and privilege accorded to him by rank. Who is the other central character?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Oliver?&quot; guesses Harold Giles, one of the boys who is usually found on the baseball field.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;No, not Oliver. Alice, do you know?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Alice Whitfield puts her hand down, folding it in front of her. &quot;The other main character is Rosalind,&quot; she says. &quot;Rosalind and Orlando are the central romantic figures. They meet at first and fall in love, but then later on Rosalind is disguised as a boy.&quot; She looks a little smug. &quot;I did this play over the summer so I know it really well. I played Celia.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Very good, Alice,&quot; $eng says. &lt;&lt;if $openzeta == true&gt;&gt;&quot;You might notice that this particular play resonates with &lt;&lt;if $sex == &quot;male&quot;&gt;&gt;Mr&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;Miss&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; $lastname&#39;s situation, where a female character is disguised as a male character.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;&quot;You may find it unusual that the author chose to have a female character disguised as a male character.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; This was actually a common element of Shakespeare&#39;s plays, because ... why? Does anyone know?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Because all the parts were played by men,&quot; Alice reports confidently.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Correct. Now, let us break down the first scene...&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;And $eng spends the rest of the class discussing how Orlando ran away to the Forest of Arden to get away from it all. You know how he must have felt.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;display &quot;NextClassLink&quot;&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;\
&lt;&lt;if $day == 4&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Today is the day $eng expects you to form groups for //As You Like It// and prepare to read a scene in front of the class. The students mill around, forming into little knots, trying to decide who to team up with. The calculations are swift and merciless: who&#39;s cool enough to be seen with? who&#39;s going to do the work and not drag everyone&#39;s grade down? are the cute ones already taken?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You and Doris Thacker quickly end up as a pair, because you sit right next to one another. She&#39;s a cute brunette &lt;&lt;if ($openzeta == true and $sex == &quot;female&quot;) or ($newid == true and $sex == &quot;male&quot;)&gt;&gt;who recognized you from your first day as a girl in Home Ec.&lt;&lt;elseif ($openzeta == true and $sex == &quot;male&quot;) or ($secret == true and $sex == &quot;female&quot;)&gt;&gt;who remembers you from the first day in Home Ec.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;who seems nice enough.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; There are a couple of other pairs who are looking to form a group of four, so you have to decide who to team up with.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;There&#39;s Ray Barnes, a scruffy-looking lad with an uneven collar and untucked-in shirt, paired up with Harold Giles, the second baseman on the school baseball team. &lt;&lt;if $openzeta == true&gt;&gt;Ray doesn&#39;t seem to like you much, and had apparently been making jokes about you to Harold, because Harold looks uncomfortable at the idea of teaming up with you.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;Ray seems to have a bad attitude toward class in general, while Harold just looks uncomfortable.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;The other pair is Arlene Stewart and Alice Whitfield. You remember Alice as an amateur drama enthusiast, who positively gushes about Shakespeare. You remember Arlene &lt;&lt;if $startsex == &quot;female&quot;&gt;&gt;from previous years as a judgmental princess who only seems to have gotten worse over the summer.&lt;&lt;elseif $openzeta == true&gt;&gt;as a haughty, condescending young woman who commented on your unshaved legs in gym class.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;from previous years as someone with a confident, superior attitude that never liked you very much.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Pick us,&quot; Ray demands. &quot;There&#39;s no good scenes with only two people. Either you get all the lines or you don&#39;t say nothin&#39; at all. And I ain&#39;t reading no girl parts or love scenes.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Like anyone would read a love scene with //you,// Ray,&quot; Arelene says waspishly.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;And anyway, they were //all// men&#39;s parts when Shakespeare did it,&quot; Alice retorts. &quot;I did this play over the summer and we cast a //ton// of male parts as women. That&#39;s how you //do// Shakespeare.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Does it really matter?&quot; Harold says, exasperated. &quot;Just pick something and do it. It won&#39;t kill you.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;What do you say, $currname?&quot; Doris asks you.&lt;/div&gt;

He and his sister are both in the school choir. &quot;Does anybody know?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I hear it&#39;s swimming for four weeks,&quot; another boy answers. He&#39;s Joe Turner, a boy you recognize but don&#39;t know very well.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Aw, gee,&quot; says Henry, stricken. &quot;Not //swimming.//&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;What&#39;s the matter with swimming?&quot; Joe asks. &quot;You go swimming all the time down at the lake.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Yes, but not //naked,//&quot; Henry objects.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;The other boy laughs. &quot;Sure you do. I&#39;ve seen you go skinny-dipping before.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Besides, you know those swimsuits aren&#39;t hygenic,&quot; another boy points out. &quot;You wear clothes, you&#39;ll get the pool all dirty. Everybody knows that.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;set $newknowns to [36, 7, 16, 22]&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;display &quot;NewKnowns&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;What&#39;s old Mrs Bell going to make us do?&quot; asks one girl, a tenth-grader named Arlene Stewart. You recognize her, but you don&#39;t know her that well.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;My brother says four weeks of swimming,&quot; says another girl. She&#39;s Irene Murphy. She and her brother are in the school choir.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Oh no!&quot; Arelene says, turning ashen.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;What&#39;s wrong with swimming?&quot; asks Irene.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;You&#39;re a freshman. You wouldn&#39;t //know,//&quot; Arlene sniffs. It&#39;s those horrible old school swimsuits. You can see right through them.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I like swimming,&quot; says Florence Foster. Everybody say she&#39;s the girl with the biggest tits in tenth grade, maybe in the whole school.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Well, you would,&quot; says skinny Arlene. &quot;//You// float.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;\
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;//Ugh. Swimming.// You hope against hope that you don&#39;t have to, but it turns out your worst nightmare has come true. $thisgym is going to make everybody swim.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Fortunately, that day will not be today. &quot;There&#39;s no need to dress for class today. Before we do any exercises, we&#39;ve got to get everybody measured and weighed in,&quot; $thisgym announces. &quot;It&#39;s important to have a way to measure physical fitness, so we can see if you are improving your bodies and your health.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Throughout the class, &lt;&lt;if $startsex == &quot;male&quot;&gt;&gt;$thisgym talks endlessly about the need for good, solid young bodies who are ready to fight for their country at a moment&#39;s notice. He doesn&#39;t let up for a minute, often booming in some poor boy&#39;s ear as he addresses the rest of the class.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;$thisgym goes on and on about how young ladies these days have to stay in shape if they expect to catch a husband. It&#39;s an endless refrain. She often calls out specific girls who are a little under- or overweight, making loud suggestions on calisthenics and stretches the girl should start doing, and different foods she should be eating.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Luckily, measuring everybody up takes most of the whole class. &lt;&lt;if $startsex == &quot;male&quot;&gt;&gt;The gym instructor gives you a strange look when he notes your height, but he doesn&#39;t take any other awkward measurements of your strangely altered body, so that&#39;s good.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;The gym instructor nods approvingly when she takes down your height, commenting you appear to have grown another inch over the summer. She does give you a strange look when taking measurements of your waist, shoulders, and hips, but instead of barking at you, she just purses her lips and says, &quot;Well, you&#39;ll develop soon enough.&quot;&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Still, you&#39;re going to have to do something about this whole swimming thing. Is there any way you can get out of it?&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;&lt;if $day == 3&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;if $newid == true&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;There&#39;s no big announcement about your first day as a new student. Evidently $thisgym doesn&#39;t care for such formalities, or maybe $nom[$gen] figures the $girlsboys[$gen] will make friends naturally during classtime. That&#39;s a bit of a relief, because you already feel awkward sitting on a hard bench in the $girlsboys[$gen] locker room, looking around at the &lt;&lt;if $sex == &quot;female&quot;&gt;&gt;pink&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;blue&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; and green tiles and thinking, //Holy smokes, there&#39;s no $girlsboys[$oppgen] here at all. Not even me.//&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;It turns out that the boys&#39; and the girls&#39; gym classes are on exactly the same track: swimming for the first four weeks, like it or not. You may have a new gym teacher, $thisgym instead of $othergym, but the routine is the same. Almost the same, that is.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;if $sex == &quot;male&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;set $newknowns to [34, 24]&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;set $mact.push(&quot;workout&quot;)&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;display &quot;NewKnowns&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;We have to swim //naked?//&quot; you ask the boy next to you. &quot;They don&#39;t give us any swimsuits or anything?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Unhygenic, I guess,&quot; he says. &quot;Hang on, you mean they give suits to the girls?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Didn&#39;t you know?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;No.&quot; A look of suspicion comes over his face. &quot;Wait, how did //you// know?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Me? What? Oh -- I have a sister,&quot; you say lamely.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Oh,&quot; he says, his face falling. &quot;I thought you peeked in the girls&#39; locker room or something, or into the pool while they were all swimming. I&#39;m Joe Turner, by the way.&quot; He offers his hand.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You stare at his hand for a moment, before remembering you&#39;re supposed to shake it. &quot;$currname $lastname.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;$thisgym waits until all the boys have undressed. You&#39;ve never seen so many naked boys in your life, not ever. Not even at the lake, where skinny-dipping is fairly common.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;//And I&#39;m one of them,// you realize. You&#39;re standing there in the locker room with your cock hanging out. Nobody seems to notice anything unusual about that. Nobody even glances your way.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;All right, line up,&quot; $thisgym barks. &quot;First thing on the list is pool hygiene. Before you get in the pool you&#39;re going to march through the showers. It goes hot water, cold water, hot, cold, and so on. When you get to the other side, go and get in the shallow end and we&#39;ll go over pool safety rules. You should be able to get in a good half hour of swimming today.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;elseif $sex == &quot;female&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;set $newknowns to [36, 7, 22]&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;display &quot;NewKnowns&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;We have to wear //those?//&quot; you ask the girl next to you, when $thisgym starts passing out flimsy little one-piece swimsuits.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I know, they&#39;re //awful,// aren&#39;t they?&quot; the girl whispers back. &quot;They don&#39;t cover up //anything.// They&#39;re so thin. But I guess it&#39;s not hygenic to wear //too// much, so...&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;The boys don&#39;t wear anything at all,&quot; you murmur to her.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Really? Nothing at all? Cross your heart?&quot; Her eyes are bright and excited. &quot;How do you know? Did you peek?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Er, I have a cousin,&quot; you explain.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Oh, phooey,&quot; she says, crestfallen. &quot;I thought you had some secret peephole or something. By the way, I&#39;m Florence Foster.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You know who she is -- the girl that everybody says has the biggest tits in tenth grade, maybe the whole school. But you&#39;re pretending to be a new student. &quot;$currname $lastname,&quot; you say, offering a hand. She stares at it for a moment in confusion, then shakes it.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;$thisgym passes out school-issued swimsuits to each girl and waits while all the students get changed. You feel horribly exposed as you strip down, and grateful to be able to climb into the flimsy protection of the one-piece swimsuit. The material is thin and worn and the style is not flattering; it&#39;s a sleeveless design that comes down to the top of your thigh and all the way up to your neck.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You stand there with all the other girls, shivering in your suit in the cool locker room.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Didn&#39;t have time to shave your legs?&quot; asks Arlene Stewart archly, eyeing the thin hair on your calves. There&#39;s a note of haughty judgment in her voice.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Leave her alone,&quot; Florence says.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Didn&#39;t she //know// we would be swimming today? They told us //yesterday.//&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;She&#39;s new. Aren&#39;t you?&quot; Florence asks, turning to you.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Um, yes,&quot; you stammer.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;And that was it. Nobody said a word about you standing in the middle of the girls&#39; locker room. Nobody said, &quot;What are you doing here?&quot; or &quot;Hey, $name, where&#39;s your dick?&quot; They just treated you like one of the girls.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;All right, line up,&quot; $thisgym barks. &quot;First thing on the list is pool hygiene.

&lt;&lt;if $day == 4&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;There&#39;s more swimming on the docket today.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Changing in the locker room is a bit of a blur. You&#39;re still not used to the idea of being in the $girlsboys[$gen]&#39; locker room. Holy heck, you&#39;re not even used to seeing //yourself// like this. You mostly try to avert your eyes from all the naked $girlsboys[$gen] surrounding you and keep your mind on your own business. It&#39;s a little harder to keep your eyes averted as $thisgym marches everybody through the hot and cold showers.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Being in the pool isn&#39;t so bad. Hardly anyone can see anything of your body below the waterline, so it doesn&#39;t much matter. &lt;&lt;if $sex == &quot;female&quot;&gt;&gt;And you&#39;re not the only girl who doesn&#39;t want to get her hair wet -- you, of course, because you&#39;re wearing a wig, but the other girls because it&#39;s a hassle. That&#39;s where the swimming caps come in handy.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;And it&#39;s not like the other boys are spending a lot of time looking, either. From the occasional glimpses you&#39;ve seen around the pool, you don&#39;t have anything to worry about, anyway. Your dick is about the same as everybody else&#39;s in the chilly water.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Finally, Gym is over, and you can move on to your next class.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;We have new textbooks this year,&quot; $hist announces. He&#39;s a rumpled-looking man with a brown blazer that has patches on the elbows. &quot;We want to make sure all of our students have a firm grounding in American history, and that we all understand what a unique and special country this is.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;It strikes you as a little strange. You remember your teachers in previous history classes weren&#39;t afraid to criticize social issues in America. This textbook seems filled with nothing but abject praise for everything about America, and no mention of any issues or problems that might need improvement.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;$hist&#39;s reasoning soon becomes clear. &quot;The government wants to make certain that we all know what it takes to be good citizens, in light of the Communist threat which stretches around the world,&quot; he says. &quot;That means Congress is taking a much greater interest in any possible Communist threats to our way of life, including how we teach subjects like this one. We can&#39;t be too careful. Now, this might be a little different from history classes you have taken in the past--&quot; he coughs nervously-- &quot;but if any of you has any questions, feel free to see me after class.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;At least nobody says anything about the way you look.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;For the remainder of class, $hist delivers a lecture covering a thousand years of history covering the whole of Egypt, and then has the class answer questions at the end of the chapter. &quot;We&#39;re only covering Egypt and the Arab lands during this first week,&quot; he says. &quot;Next week we&#39;ll move on to the Greeks and Romans, if we get to it.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You look down at your notes. The flooding of the Nile, pharaohs, gods. Agriculture. Geometry. Building. And lots of personal opinions given by $hist about how much better America does these things, thanks to the early efforts of faraway people. It&#39;s a bit of a one-sided look, if you&#39;re being honest with yourself. It&#39;s a very //American// perspective.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You never thought so much about the value of having a new perspective before.&lt;/div&gt;

Cross your legs at the knee, and place your steno pad, thus. Now your hand is in the proper position to write, but your view of the proceedings is unobstructed. Try it.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You and the girls attempt to mimic $steno&#39;s posture, placing your writing pads properly and holding the pencil poised just so. &lt;&lt;if $sex == &quot;male&quot;&gt;&gt;Your balls feel crushed between your legs, and your hips feel a little stiff, but you manage to approximate the correst posture.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;You feel a little strange with your legs crossed, because it&#39;s so //easy.// There&#39;s nothing in the way. And your hips are wider, and your thighs thinner, so you get a better angle. It&#39;s actually quite comfortable.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Very good, girls,&quot; she says to all of you, moving around the room. &quot;Miss Morris, straighten your skirt, it&#39;s bunched up. Excellent form, Miss Watson. Miss Foster, don&#39;t hunch over, it&#39;s unladylike.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;But I can&#39;t see the page,&quot; says Florence Foster. She doesn&#39;t say it, but everybody is thinking it: her boobs are in the way.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;You don&#39;t need to see the page,&quot; $steno says. &quot;That is the whole point of stenography. You watch what is happening, and feel your way across the page with your hand. Even if a lady has a larger chest than other girls, that shouldn&#39;t be any kind of hindrance at all. There! You look like a perfect little steno pool. Let&#39;s begin with the first letters of the alphabet: S, F and V. In shorthand, these look very similar to one another.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;She proceeds to demonstrate the shorthand for safe, face, save, faces, and saves on the chalkboard. They look almost exactly the same.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;//Just like me,// you think. //Almost exactly the same, but not quite.//&lt;/div&gt;

At the lowest part of the room is the conductor&#39;s pit, where there is an old Wurlizter piano and a lectern. The chalkboards have been painted with blank musical staves.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Your teacher for Vocal Music is $music, the same instructor you had last year for 9th grade, and the year before that in junior high school. She usually has this bright, frazzled look about her, as if she has too many students and not enough brain power to keep track of it all.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;This year, she seems a little calmer. &quot;I&#39;m so glad to see so many of your lovely faces again this year,&quot; she says warmly. &quot;If any of you has a younger brother or sister, you might have heard that the school district has finally hired another music teacher for elementary and junior high, which will leave me more time for all of my high school students.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You remember the teacher shortages of 1946. After the war, there just weren&#39;t enough teachers to go around.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Oh, that&#39;s great!&quot; says Henry Murphy, and his sister Irene agrees. &quot;Congratulations, $music.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Thank you, Henry. The first thing we&#39;re going to do is sing the national anthem, and then the school song,&quot; she says. &quot;I&#39;ll go around the room as you&#39;re singing and listen to your voices, because I think some of them might still be changing. Then I can separate you into your proper registers.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;$fr nods at you. &quot;You know, I&#39;ve been thinking,&quot; $nom[$fgen] says. &quot;You said you were necking with $so the night before? And you had a ... a night dream about S-E-X?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;It didn&#39;t go that far,&quot; you whisper.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Then maybe what you have to do is repeat the experiment,&quot; $fr says. &quot;Do it again. Invite $so over and make out. See what happens.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&lt;&lt;if $sex == &quot;female&quot;&gt;&gt;&quot;But $so and I have made out loads of times before.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;&quot;But $so and I have made out before.

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Maybe not,&quot; $fr says. &quot;But in my Biology class--&quot; $nomcap[$fgen] breaks off suddenly and switches to Spanish as $span wanders by, listening. When she&#39;s gone, $fr leans in again. &quot;It got me thinking. Maybe this is a stage of development or something. This didn&#39;t happen before because you weren&#39;t //ready.//&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I&#39;m not ready //now,//&quot; you point out. &quot;Besides, this is just some temporary disease. I must have caught it somewhere.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;There&#39;s one way to test it,&quot; $fr says with a nervous smile. &quot;If you and I make out, maybe you&#39;ll have another dream and flip back to normal. If it doesn&#39;t work, then it&#39;s probably something you caught.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;But what if you catch it?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Oh, I don&#39;t think so,&quot; is $fr&#39;s breezy reply. &quot;Look at the facts. $so hasn&#39;t changed, right?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&lt;&lt;if $openzeta == true&gt;&gt;&quot;No, I saw $acc[$sogen] today.&quot;&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;&quot;No, not that I ever noticed.&quot;&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Look at you, you&#39;re a regular detective.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;$fr grins. &quot;Yes, we&#39;re a regular Nick and Nora Charles. Like from that movie, //The Thin Man.//&quot;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Well, think about it,&quot; $fr urges you quietly. &quot;Let me know what you decide. We could try tomorrow night. My old man won&#39;t be home. Or maybe it should be you and $so, to really recreate the event.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I can&#39;t blame you!&quot; $fr looks sympathetic. &quot;I wouldn&#39;t want to hang around waiting either.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Unfortunately, the instructor, $geom, is the same one you have for gym class.

I have some lessons planned where you must follow directions on a map, and then calculate the distance to a hidden gun emplacement.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;He welcomes you to the class with obvious discomfort, and briefly explains your presence to the others. By this late in the day, the reaction is more subdued. You&#39;ve already had classes with some of these boys, and they already know the story. &quot;Miss $lastname will be joining us in Geometry for the duration,&quot; he says, &quot;owing to changes in her schedule.

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You can&#39;t help but seethe a little at that. You&#39;re not an //idiot,// you&#39;re just a girl. Well ... not at the //moment//, but usually.

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Very close. It is //presumed// to be true,&quot; $geom corrects him. &quot;It cannot be proven, but its truth is self-evident. Geometry begins with several axioms -- fundamental definitions that form a foundation that everything else rests upon. Can anyone give an example of an axiom?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;East is east and west is west,&quot; offers Gerald Myers.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;And never the twain shall meet,&quot; $geom says, finishing the Kipling quote. &quot;Very good. The logical principle of self-identity. Anyone else?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;

You young ladies may also use these math skills for running a household and making a budget for you and your husband,&quot; he adds, as an afterthought.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;//Oh really? Then my husband is going to be in for a surprise,// you think with a mixture of humor and dread.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Those of you who graduate high school and go on to college,&quot; $bkp continues, &quot;will be able to take courses in higher mathematics later on. This course will focus on the practical, every-day life skills that you&#39;ll need to be a prosperous businessman. Or even a savvy homemaker.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;He passes out textbooks after that, and you&#39;re left to wonder which one of those two things you&#39;re likely to be.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Yes, it&#39;s true, we have a new student among us,&quot; $bkp says briskly, clasping his hands together. He&#39;s an older man with a military bearing and a no-nonsense haircut. &quot;If you haven&#39;t already heard, this is Miss $lastname, who will be joining us in Bookkeeping, due to a, uh, a kind of medical condition, apparently. Luckily for you, it means you don&#39;t have to take any higher mathematics,&quot; he adds with a condescending smile. &quot;But that&#39;s all right, a lot of girls do very well in basic business math, and I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll be just the same. You //might// even have an advantage!&quot; His eyes twinkle with merriment.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You can&#39;t help but feel a little stung by this. You&#39;ve been turned into a //girl//, not an imbecile. You&#39;re pretty sure you could still do math if you wanted.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;No yawning, ladies,&quot; he says with a condescending smile. &quot;You&#39;ll want your wits about you for today&#39;s lesson.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You can&#39;t help but wonder if he&#39;d treat you the same way if he knew you weren&#39;t a girl any more.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;\
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;When everyone is settled, $bkp draws some lines on the board. &quot;All right, girls, today we&#39;re going to be going over the basics of a balance sheet, which is what we&#39;ll be using all year. This is important, so be sure to take very good notes. If you don&#39;t understand this concept, you&#39;re going to find yourself struggling later on.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;//It&#39;s adding and subtracting,// you sigh to yourself. //We&#39;ve been doing this for years. How difficult does he think this is?//&lt;/div&gt;

The instructor is $homeec, a youthful woman with a cheery smile, a Midwestern twang, and a frilly apron over her day dress. She assures the class that she has a science degree in Household Management from the University of Iowa.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;In order to run a successful home,&quot; $homeec says in a clear voice, &quot;the modern woman is going to have to know not only how to //use// all of her labor-saving machines, but how to conduct her own repairs. Imagine it, ladies: you&#39;re cooking dinner for your husband, and you&#39;re making a nice aspic. Let&#39;s say you&#39;re making jellied eggs. You&#39;re mixing up the gelatin. Suddenly, the Mixmaster breaks. How are you going to manage?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;The girls exchange concerned looks. &quot;Use a hand beater?&quot; asks Doris Thacker in a timid voice. You remember her from your English class.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Possibly, yes. That&#39;s one way to do it. But after this class,&quot; $homeec says, &quot;you&#39;ll be able to take apart your own Mixmaster and see what&#39;s wrong. You&#39;ll be able to repair that loose wire, or change out a frayed cord, or replace a bad fuse, all by yourself. Not only is it economical, and it will save your family money, but you&#39;ll never have to worry your husband about little household chores like this. That aspic will come out of the refrigerator on time!&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;A girl named Evelyn Cox raises her hand, with a worried look on her face. &quot;$homeec,&quot; she says, &quot;aren&#39;t these machines full of oil and grease and such?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Some of them, yes,&quot; $homeec says gravely, &quot;but with the right soaps and detergents, you&#39;ll be able to clean up any messes. We don&#39;t want you girls to worry about getting your hands dirty. Remember, most of your mothers worked in the factories during the war!&quot; She gives the class an encouraging smile. &quot;And just in case we ever need you young ladies to march off to the factory floors again, we need to make sure you&#39;re familiar with basic household tools.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Somehow, you think another fate might be in store for you, if anybody ever finds out what&#39;s happened underneath your skirt.&lt;/div&gt;

By now, practically everyone in the school knows about you. That&#39;s good //and// bad, you suppose.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;The girls in Home Ec are no exception. A small knot of girls approaches you to say hello, blushing and staring, before retreating back to the other side of the room. Josephine Gray comes over, examining your outfit archly, to comment that she used to have a dress like yours ... when she was twelve. Evelyn Cox helpfully points out that your stocking seams aren&#39;t straight, and fixes them for you.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;The instructor, a cheerful young woman with a Midwestern twang named $homeec, seems almost too enthusiastic about Home Economics for her own good. &quot;Good afternoon, my fabulous little stars!&quot; she says brightly. &quot;Is everybody excited to start thinking about your very first project?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;elseif $secret == true&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Even though it&#39;s the last class of the day, $homeec comes bounding into the room with energy and good cheer. &quot;Good afternoon, my fabulous little stars!&quot; she says brightly. &quot;Is everybody excited to start thinking about your very first project?&quot;&lt;/div?
&lt;&lt;elseif $oldid == true&gt;&gt;(You are your old self again. The player is start-female. This is impossible on Day 3. If this pops up, it is an ERROR.)

&lt;&lt;set $newknowns to [6, 23, 9]&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;display &quot;NewKnowns&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;She proceeds to announce that the first project is sewing, and that every girl in the class will be making herself a new dress. &quot;Or something else if you&#39;d like,&quot; she adds. &quot;This is really just a refresher for all your sewing skills.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Evelyn raises her hand. &quot;$homeec, what if we aren&#39;t very good at sewing?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;That&#39;s only natural,&quot; she says, waving one hand reassuringly. &quot;I know a lot of you gals didn&#39;t get a lot of instructions from your mothers during the war years. Mom was away making shells and airplanes, and didn&#39;t have any time to show you the basics. It&#39;s all right.&quot; Her broad Midwestern twang shows through on the word //right.// &quot;If you don&#39;t know how to baste, or how to do a running stitch or a backstitch, we&#39;ll cover those in class. Chain stitches, blanket stitches, buttons, you name it. Your project is going to have to show that you&#39;ve mastered each and every one of them, and we&#39;ll also be using my electric Singer sewing machine I brought from home.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;What kind of dresses can we make?&quot; asks Doris Thacker, the girl from your English class.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Any kind you like,&quot; $homeec says encouragingly. &quot;I suggest you bring one from home so you can figure out the pattern. That gives you something to go from. You&#39;ll draw up your design and make your changes, choose a fabric, and when you&#39;re all done, you&#39;ll have a brand-new dress that&#39;s entirely your own.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;The girls seem enthusiastic about the idea.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Doesn&#39;t that sound great?&quot; $homeec says, practically bubbling with delight. &quot;But first things first: we&#39;re going to have to take proper measurements for all you gals, in order so you can make your dress the right size. Write these down, because these are the basic measurements we&#39;ll need for all of you.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;The rest of the day is spent with cloth tape measures: around waists and hips, around arms, around wrists, measuring the lengths of arms and legs, even — it&#39;s ticklish to think about — having another girl reaching under your skirt to measure your thighs.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;All around you, the girls are comparing their numbers. &quot;Nineteen inch thighs, Ruby? That&#39;s amazing!&quot; gushes Evelyn. &quot;Mine are twenty-four. I feel like a big cow.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I //can&#39;t// have a twenty-three inch waist, I just //can&#39;t//,&quot; Doris wails to her partner, Josephine. &quot;Scarlett O&#39;Hara&#39;s waist was only seventeen inches!&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Scarlett O&#39;Hara?&quot; asks Jo blankly. &quot;What school does she go to?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;It looks like it&#39;s going to be a long semester.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;display &quot;CleanReturn&quot;&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;\
&lt;&lt;if $day == 4&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Today, $homeec takes the entire class period to talk about different kinds of fabrics, the different ways fabrics can be joined, and what kind of stitches are best. &quot;We can&#39;t cover all of them in one day,&quot; she tells the class, &quot;but I can make sure you gals have a good solid understanding of the right ways to create a seam. Now, if Miss Russell would like to come up to the counter and collect that tray — yes, that one, with the pincushions — we&#39;re going to start with a simple baste. It&#39;s the most basic of stitches, and it will be used for ... does anybody know?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;if $openzeta == true or $newid == true&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;After that, it&#39;s threading needles and practicing your stitching.

&lt;&lt;elseif $secret == true&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;After that, it&#39;s threading needles and practicing your stitching.

&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;\
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;This weekend you should start thinking about what kind of clothing you&#39;d like to make for your first project,&quot; $homeec says. &quot;Bring your ideas in on Monday and we&#39;ll get started.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;This!&quot; he calls out gruffly, holding up his disfigured hand. &quot;This, boys, is the kind of thing that can happen to you, if you don&#39;t listen carefully to me and you don&#39;t use the proper safety equipment in this class. I will be signing you off on every piece of equipment in my shop before you are allowed to touch it. You see the yellow lines on the floor? Right there, around the band saw, and the lathe? Those are your safety lines. If you&#39;re not using that tool, you must stand behind that yellow line. Yes, you,&quot; he says, pointing to a boy with a raised hand.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;How did you lose your fingers?&quot; asks Ralph Ward. He&#39;s a tall, blond young man who happens to be the new quarterback this year.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;In the war,&quot; $shop says, looking down. &quot;It&#39;s a story for later. I&#39;ll tell you boys some other time.&quot; He seems uncomfortable, and moves on quickly. &quot;Believe me, you do not want to lose part of your hand! Imagine not being able to go fishing, or shoot a bow at summer camp. Imagine not being able to work at your father&#39;s store because you can&#39;t carry anything heavy.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;//I can imagine it,// you think to yourself.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;And that is why I expect each one of you to pay close attention. If I see you daydreaming or lollygagging, I will send you out of class for the day, and you will get a zero on attendance. No exceptions.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Are we going to work on any metals this year?&quot; asks one boy.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Raise your hand first, Paul. No, we are not doing any metals this year. The Industrial Arts program has expanded to a second course, just for metalworking and machining, so if you would rather be in that course, talk to the school secretary and get your class changed. Yes, you.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Ralph speaks, his eyes still fixed on $shop&#39;s mangled right hand. &quot;What if we don&#39;t want to take shop any more? I don&#39;t want to injure my throwing hand.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;It&#39;s mandatory,&quot; $shop says curtly. &quot;These are skills every boy should learn. You can&#39;t be much of a man unless you can fix things up around the house.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;//There&#39;s another qualification,// you think. //And right now, I don&#39;t meet it.//&lt;/div&gt;

By now, practically everyone in the school knows about you. That&#39;s good //and// bad, you suppose.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;The boys in Wood Shop are no exception. A couple of them are eyeing you suspiciously, as if searching for signs that you might not belong. Apparently they don&#39;t see anything that provokes them, because mostly the reaction you receive is total indifference.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;The teacher is a grizzled old man with a cast eye named $shop, who is missing the first two fingers on his right hand, and who has a habit of emphasizing the rules of wood shop safety by recalling gruesome shop accidents. He has a story for every machine, a foolhardy and errant young lad for every occasion. It&#39;s morbidly fascinating somehow.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;elseif $secret == true&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;$shop begins today&#39;s lessons with another round of his favorite hobby, wherein he illustrates the need for wood shop safety by recalling gruesome shop accidents.

&lt;&lt;elseif $oldid == true&gt;&gt;(You are your old self again. We may assume the player is start-male. This is impossible on Day 3. If this pops up, it is an ERROR.)


&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;\
&lt;&lt;set $newknowns to [25, 10]&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;display &quot;NewKnowns&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;A couple of years ago, some kid, who wasn&#39;t following the rules about safety near the band saw, he stepped across the yellow line, and turned around too fast without looking and cut off the tip of his thumb. Now you boys,&quot; $shop says sternly, glaring around with rheumy eyes, &quot;you //listen// when I tell you to be careful with this equipment, or that could happen to you.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;After that, he passes out a short quiz about shop safety regarding the band saw. The pages are damp and smell of fresh mimeograph ink, and most of the questions are crudely phrased, multiple-choice, and obvious. You doubt whether he spends much time writing them. Or grading them.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;All right, boys,&quot; he says, when he has collected the pages, &quot;you are going to be working on several projects this semester, but you should start thinking about your final project now. Maybe you want to build a new box for your tools, or for fishing tackle. You could make a wooden rack for your father&#39;s easy chair, to hold his pipe and newspapers. Maybe you&#39;d like to make your best girl a jewelry box for her pretty things. It&#39;s up to you. Your project has to be sanded and finished, it has to have hardware attached — a hinge or a latch or a lid, something like that. Tt has to have at least one seamless joint. And it has to have at least one fitted angle and one curve. It can&#39;t all be easy straight lines. Yes — Ralph.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Can I do a glass case for a football?&quot; asks Ralph Ward, the new sophomore quarterback.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Why, you planning on //winning?//&quot; asks Paul Sanders with a nasty grin.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Yes, a case will be fine, if it has a hinged lid. Anyone else? Yes, you —&quot; $shop consults his sketch of the students at their workbenches. &quot;Jack Kelly?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;The boy with the raised hand nods. &quot;Y-yes. Uh, what about a n-new, a n-n-new b-butt for my b-b-BB gun?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;No join on that,&quot; $shop says disapprovingly. &quot;No hardware. Unless you take a wood bit and hollow out the back, make a little carrying space for extra BBs.&quot; The old man rubs his whiskered chin. &quot;If you take a couple smaller pieces of walnut and laminate them together...&quot; He shrugs. &quot;Talk to me after class about that one.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;After that, all the boys are calling out their ideas, often forgetting to raise their hands. It becomes a free-for-all discussion forum on various things they could build, if only they had the knowledge.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I know you&#39;re all excited,&quot; $shop says at last. &quot;Most of you grew up, your fathers were off in Europe fighting. They didn&#39;t have time to raise you good and teach you proper tool use. Well, we&#39;re going to take care of that in this class, give you boys a firm foundation on what it means to be a man.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You&#39;re not sure whether that&#39;s possible at this point, but given the week you&#39;ve had, you wouldn&#39;t rule it out.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;display &quot;CleanReturn&quot;&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;\
&lt;&lt;if $day == 4&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Today, $shop spends the entire day talking about different kinds of wood, different grains and hardness, and things to watch out for. &quot;Green wood,&quot; he says, &quot;that&#39;s going to warp on you as it dries out. It&#39;ll get you every time, bend all over the place, like it&#39;s moving on its own. Always check your wood. You want good, hard wood, nice and straight, no curves or bends or twists.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;The way $shop keeps talking about &quot;wood&quot; causes all the boys in class to stiffle a snicker.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;$shop,&quot; says Glenn Baker with a straight face, &quot;what if your wood is too big?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Another round of snorts goes around the room. Paul Sanders hides his face to conceal a smirk.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;You should always look for wood that&#39;s close to the right size,&quot; $shop replies, oblivious. &quot;It minimizes waste. But make sure to measure. Better too big than too small.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;if $openzeta == true or $newid == true&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;For the first time, it occurs to you to wonder whether your &quot;wood&quot; is too big or too small. Do all boys worry about this?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;elseif $secret == true&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You wonder for a moment whether your &quot;wood&quot; is too big or too small, before it occurs to you that you have no way to measure it. Your wood is AWOL at the moment.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;elseif $oldid == true&gt;&gt;(Could be male or female. This is impossible on Day 4. If this pops up, it is an ERROR.)


&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;\

	Here we have to choose which schedule the player will adhere to
	on any specific day. This means we calculate the following:
	
	1. Is the player presently male or female?
	2. Is the player known to be a Zeta?
		a. The school knows the player is a Zeta.
			i. Player must attend sex-appropriate classes.
			ii. Player may attend previous classes, with exemptions.
		b. The school doesn&#39;t know the player is a Zeta.
			i. Player is masquerading as starting sex.
			ii. Player is masquerading as a new student of opp sex.

	The logic goes like this:
	
	KNOWN TG: the school knows
		REVEAL TG: you&#39;re open about becoming opp sex
			RESULT: same schedule, with exceptions (skip gym, etc).
		NON-REVEAL TG: you&#39;re hiding when you&#39;re the opp sex
			RESULT: masquerade as opp sex; opp schedule, w exceptions.
	UNKNOWN TG: the school has no idea
		REVEAL TG: you&#39;re open about becoming opp sex
			RESULT: masquerade as opp sex; opp schedule, no exceptions.
		NON-REVEAL TG: you&#39;re hiding when you&#39;re the opp sex
			RESULT: same schedule, no exceptions (skip class or bring
			a note from home).

	boy schedule: player is boy or dickgirl; participates fully as a
		male in that class
	girl schedule: player is pussyboy or girl; participates fully as a
		female in that class
	
	pussyboy schedule: player is pussyboy; school excludes certain
		classes while the player is unable to participate
	dickgirl schedule: player is dickgirl; school excuses certain
		classes when the player is unable to participate
	
	secret girl schedule: player is pussyboy; participates in class but
		has to hide certain things or bring a note
	secret boy schedule: player is dickgirl; participates in class but
		has to hide certain things or bring a note

&lt;&lt;endsilently&gt;&gt;</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="40" name="1948 Skip First Day" tags="" position="2350,950" size="100,100">&lt;&lt;if $page == 0&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;True to her word, Mom returned the castor oil, her all-purpose remedy for any kind of stomach ailment, and she made you drink two spoonfuls. It means you&#39;ll have to spend the next several hours close to the toilet, and that makes you reconsider the idea of playing sick. You can&#39;t keep this up forever or you&#39;ll have to sleep in the bathroom until you turn eighteen.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Apart from that, however, she leaves you to your own devices. At eight-thirty, she announces that she&#39;s leaving to drive $sibnick to school, which starts a little later than yours. &quot;And then I&#39;ll go to the grocery store,&quot; she calls up the stairs. &quot;If I&#39;m making chicken soup, we&#39;ll need a few things.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Thanks, Mom!&quot; you call back.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;If you&#39;re feeling up to it,&quot; she says, &quot;you might have a hot bath while I&#39;m out. I find that helps me sometimes.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Okay!&quot;&lt;/div&gt; You feel strange shouting, as if Mom is going to recognize some change in your voice.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;But she doesn&#39;t say anything about it. A few minutes later and you hear $sib thundering down the stairs, then back up to retrieve her forgotten satchel, then back down again. The front door closes with a click. You hear the sound of Mom&#39;s old Packard starting fitfully to life. It drives away.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;The house falls eerily silent.&lt;/div&gt;
--[[go check yourself in the hall mirror|1948 Skip First Day][$page to 1]]
--[[sneak downstairs for some breakfast|1948 Skip First Day][$page to 2]]
&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;\
&lt;&lt;if $page == 1&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You haven&#39;t really had a proper chance to do this. A brief survey, if that, in the bathroom. Now that the house is yours and there&#39;s no danger of anyone walking in on you, you rush to the full-length mirror hanging at the top of the stairs. &lt;&lt;if $startsex == &quot;female&quot;&gt;&gt;You have a vanity mirror, but it&#39;s fairly small, and it&#39;s set at desk height.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;You have a small facial mirror for combing your hair, but it&#39;s small and doesn&#39;t show much.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; The mirror in the hall is better.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You peel off your &lt;&lt;if $startsex == &quot;female&quot;&gt;&gt;nightgown, your girdle, and all your layers of underwear,&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;pajama top and bottom, kick off your underwear, &lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; and get a good look at what you&#39;re dealing with.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;if $startsex == &quot;female&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You&#39;re a boy, all right. There&#39;s no doubt about it. Your whole body says so.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Your shoulders are about the same width, maybe a bit broader, and you have slightly more muscle. There&#39;s a few little tufts of hair on your chest, and your boobs are so flat — disappeared entirely, actually — that you can see the pectorals underneath. There&#39;s even a faint trail of hairs on your belly leading downward from your navel. And hairs on your shoulders. And hairs on your forearms. Hairs everywhere.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Your hands are a tiny bit bigger. Not much, but a little. Your chin seems a fraction more square, and your brow slightly more prominent. If you didn&#39;t know better, at first glance you&#39;d say this was the face of a teenage boy. But it&#39;s still you. You frown at your face closely, running your fingers on your chin. No signs of stubble, but maybe just a few wipsy hairs on your upper lip.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;And the penis, of course. It hangs there, getting in the way, a shaft and a hanging sack containing your testicles, sitting there like a new student in class you&#39;ve never met before. It&#39;s hard to stand in the usual way, feet close, thighs pressed together. You feel pinched up, like your balls need a little room to breathe. When your feet are spread apart, it&#39;s much more comfortable.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You&#39;re a girl, all right. There&#39;s no doubt about it. Your whole body says so.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Your shoulders are a fraction more narrow, and your arms seem to have lost some muscle. They look like pipestems. You weren&#39;t all that strong before, but now you look practically anemic. The wisps of chest hair that you had been carefully cultivating are gone, as is the hair on your lower belly. Even the hair on your arms is finer and fainter than before. And your nipples seem prouder. Puffier. Your chest, never in the league of a Charles Atlas to begin with, seems oddly squishy.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Your hands are a tiny bit smaller and more slender. Not so much that you&#39;d notice unless you knew what to look for. Your chin seems less prominent, your jaw more delicate. If you didn&#39;t know better, at first glance you&#39;d say this was the face of a teenage girl. But it&#39;s still you. You frown at your face closely, running your fingers on your chin. No signs of stubble. None at all. Not even those telltale little hairs on your upper lip.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;And your cock is missing, of course. It used to just //be// there, like an old friend, whenever you glanced at yourself. Now it&#39;s absent, like a student suddenly missing from class who leaves an empty desk behind. There&#39;s nothing there except a small breeze between your legs that makes you feel peculiarly vulnerable. If you stand with your feet close and your thighs pressed together, that feeling is a little less bothersome.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;\
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Okay, $name,&quot; you tell your naked reflection. &quot;Now what?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
--[[take a bath|1948 Skip First Day][$page to 3]]
&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;\
&lt;&lt;if $page == 2&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You&#39;ve been ravenously hungry ever since you woke up. It&#39;s time for some breakfast.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Checking to make sure the coast is clear, even though you&#39;re positive that Mom has already left, you creep down the stairs. There&#39;s no sign of anyone, so you relax and head for the kitchen.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;There&#39;s a little Malt-O-Meal left on the stovetop, although all the rest of the breakfast dishes have been scrubbed and tucked away in the drainage rack beside the sink. You manage to eat some — cold, unfortunately — and that helps a little. Now you don&#39;t feel quite so empty.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;The remains of Dad&#39;s morning newspaper are strewn about the kitchen table. All the sections have been separated, folded backward, and turned this way and that. This is usually how he leaves the newspaper in the morning. Mom has a look through the headlines and flips through the classified ads, then she tidies it away. Eventually the newspaper ends up in the firewood storage bin next to the kindling.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;As you glance over the newspaper, the word //polio// catches your eye.&lt;/div&gt;
--[[check newspaper about polio|1948 Skip First Day][$page to 4, $path.push(&quot;polio newspaper&quot;)]]
&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;\
&lt;&lt;if $page == 3&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Since your mother mentioned it, you decide a hot bath might help you throw off some of this worry. It might not change you back to normal, but it certainly couldn&#39;t hurt. There&#39;s even some soap flakes, so you can have a nice modest bubble bath, &lt;&lt;if $startsex == &quot;male&quot;&gt;&gt;although it&#39;s going to make you feel a bit like Ava Gardner in //One Touch of Venus//, that movie $so dragged you to last month.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;just like Ava Gardner in //One Touch of Venus//, that movie you dragged $so to last month.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;At first, it&#39;s quite relaxing. The hot water washes away your accumulated tension, and the mounds of bubbles conceal the shape of your body beneath the water so you don&#39;t have to think about it.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;But bubbles can only do so much, and eventually your hands brush up against the wrong bit of flesh, or your thighs slide together from all that slippery soap, and you notice all over again that your body isn&#39;t the same shape as it always was. Your very skin is no longer so familiar to you.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Should you try to acquaint yourself with your body? Explore with your hands? You have to clean yourself, after all.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;With your hands, you start exploring your new flesh. Gingerly. Guiltily. It goes against everything your &lt;&lt;if $startsex == &quot;female&quot;&gt;&gt;mother says, about how good Girl Scouts don&#39;t get merit badges playing panty polo.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;father says, that you&#39;ll never make Eagle Scout by getting merit badges in pocket pool.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; On the other hand, $thisgym is always going on about &quot;hygiene,&quot; which means cleanliness, and you&#39;ve never //been// in this shape before, so you&#39;re sure it&#39;s never been cleaned.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You &lt;&lt;if $startsex == &quot;female&quot;&gt;&gt;touch your new penis daintily, withdrawing quickly, but nothing happens. It doesn&#39;t do anything. It certainly shows no signs of becoming enormous and randy, like Mildred Sacks said penises do sometimes. There&#39;s just some extra flesh there. You can touch it and pull it, but it remains inert.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;prod yourself down there, going by feel, not sure what you&#39;ll find. There is some pliable flesh, like lips, with a warm opening in between if you poke around a little. Nothing unusual happens. Tentatively, you feel around and find a little knob of flesh. That must be the magic button, which is what Jimmy O&#39;Toole called that secret part of a woman that makes her go crazy for you. But this little nub doesn&#39;t seem to do anything.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Disappointed, you finish your bath. You were half-expecting some big, exciting sensations from your new equipment. Changing into a $girlboy[$gen] hardly seems worth the trouble so far.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;There&#39;s got to be //somebody// you can talk to about all of this.&lt;/div&gt;
--[[call doctor|1948 Skip First Day][$page to 5, $path.push(&quot;call doctor&quot;)]]
&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;\
&lt;&lt;if $page == 4&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;The headline reads MORE BAD NEWS FOR KIND POLIO VACCINE.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You turn the newspaper toward you and read the article. Apparently, a number of years ago a doctor named Horace Kind had run some experiments on a new polio vaccine. It hadn&#39;t worked out, of course, because Mom and Pop were still flipping out about the dangers of polio.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You check the rest of the headlines. There&#39;s another suspected outbreak, this one in Auburn, which is not too far from here. That must have been what they were hinting at last night.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;//Wait a minute, maybe that&#39;s what this is,// you think. //It&#39;s some new kind of ... $girlboy[$gen] disease, and I happened to catch it somehow.//&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;The headlines on the front page don&#39;t mention anything about any such disease. It just goes on about HUAC, an acronym that seems familiar. The House Unamerican Affairs Committee, according to the article. Communists being investigated everywhere. Alger Hiss. That&#39;s right, you remember now. No sign of any mysterious disease affecting teenagers in the Puget Sound area.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;If anybody would know anything about such a disease, your family doctor might.&lt;/div&gt;
--[[call doctor|1948 Skip First Day][$page to 5, $path.push(&quot;call doctor&quot;)]]
&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;\
&lt;&lt;if $page == 5&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Dr Bennett&#39;s number is written on a smudged piece of piece of paper and tacked to a small corkboard beside the kitchen telephone. You haven&#39;t had to call this number since $sibnick fell down the porch steps and broke her arm a few summers ago.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Doctor Bennett&#39;s office,&quot; says a chirpy receptionist.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Hi, my name is $name &lt;&lt;textbox &quot;$lastname&quot; $lastname&gt;&gt;. My mom takes me to your office sometimes. May I speak with Dr Bennett?&quot; you ask.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;She asks you to spell your name, and you can hear her busily thumbing through some files. &quot;Kendall,&quot; she says triumphantly. &quot;Hold, please, while I see if the doctor is in.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Moments later, a man&#39;s voice comes on the line. &quot;This is Bob Bennett.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Unable to contain yourself, you launch into an explanation of your strange morning, rushing through all the feelings of oddness in your new body, your concern that you have no idea how it happened, having to skip school, not knowing how to change back, and hoping your parents don&#39;t find out about it. Dr Bennett listens carefully on the other end, occasionally making noises of confirmation and asking questions.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Finally, he clears his throat. &quot;Well, I suppose I could make time to see you this afternoon. I remember reading about something like this before, but it&#39;s been a few months, and it didn&#39;t seem all that reliable at the time. Would three o&#39;clock do?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Uh, yes, I suppose,&quot; you say. &quot;I&#39;m home from school all day. I was just hoping—&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Hoping that Irene — your mother — doesn&#39;t find out, eh?&quot; he asks knowingly. &quot;Don&#39;t worry. I&#39;ll do a quick exam in your room, if that&#39;s all right with you.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;That sounds about as good an arrangement as you could expect, so you agree and hang up.&lt;/div&gt;
--[[go back to your bedroom|1948 Skip First Day][$page to 6]]
&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;\
&lt;&lt;if $page == 6&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You rush back to your bedroom just in time. Mom&#39;s car pulls up in the driveway just as you&#39;re crawling back into bed.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;For the next few hours, you hear pots and pans clanking in the kitchen as you sit alone in your bedroom, your mind racing. You&#39;re still a $girlboy[$gen] and it&#39;s been //hours.// Nothing has changed.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You try to sleep, but you can&#39;t quite drift off. Who knows what would happen if you let your eyes slip shut?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;It must be hours later when Mom knocks on the door. &quot;Would you like some soup?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
--[[eat lunch|1948 Skip First Day][$page to 7]]
&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;\
&lt;&lt;if $page == 7&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You&#39;re still ravenously hungry, so you eat three bowls of soup before it finally feels like you&#39;re getting filled up. Whatever happened to your body last night, it must have taken a lot of effort.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Mom comes to collect the bowl a little later, commenting happily on how your appetite seems to be coming back. Perhaps you overdid it a little on the soup.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;if $path.includes(&quot;call doctor&quot;)&gt;&gt;--[[wait for Dr Bennett|1948 Skip First Day][$page to 8]]&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;--[[try to take a nap|1948 Skip First Day][$page to 9]]&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;\
&lt;&lt;if $page == 8&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You while away the hours until your appointment by trying to nap, but it doesn&#39;t seem to work.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Eventually, you hear the sound of the telephone downstairs. After a few minutes of muffled speech, Mom climbs the stairs to your bedroom and informs you that Dr Bennett will be a little late. &quot;Did you ask the doctor to make a house call?&quot; she asks, worried.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;He offered,&quot; you say, without elaborating.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Ah. Well, that&#39;s all right. Shall I send him up when he arrives?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Dr Bennett is a man of middle years with graying hair, a heavy-set frame, and a rather lumpy face. He usually smells of antiseptic and sometimes of gin. Mom lets him into your room without a word, and he sets down a black leather bag on your desk.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Good to see you again, $name,&quot; he says in a kind, gruff voice, adjusting his head mirror. &quot;Shall we see what you&#39;re dealing with?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;He makes you undress halfway, and performs a brief and professional inspection of the key areas of your body. With a grunt, he rises to his feet, gesturing for you to &lt;&lt;if $startsex == &quot;male&quot;&gt;&gt;pull up your pajamas.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;pull up your panties and fix your nightgown.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; &quot;Well, I see what you&#39;re talking about,&quot; he says after a moment, puzzled. &quot;I&#39;ll be dipped if I can figure out why it happened, though. I think I&#39;ll try to find out where I read about that other case. Must have been a medical journal. Don&#39;t think it was the newspaper.&quot; He conks himself genially on the head with one fist. &quot;Getting old, I guess.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;if $path.includes(&quot;polio newspaper&quot;)&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I was reading about polio in the newspaper today,&quot; you say. &quot;Maybe this is some new-fangled disease or other, do you think?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Disease? Hard to say. I&#39;ve never seen a disease like ... wait a minute. Polio, polio.&quot; Dr Bennett frowns. &quot;There was a polio vaccine trial with some odd side effects. I think your mother was a part of it. Maybe — okay, $name, I know you&#39;re anxious to find out what&#39;s happened to you, but this is just a hypothesis, so don&#39;t mention it to anyone. Not yet. I&#39;m probably remembering it wrong. Let me find that old medical journal and look up this case. I&#39;ll call around, too. Maybe Dr Lambert or Dr Phillips remembers the details.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I promise,&quot; you say, holding up one hand, like you do when you take your scouting oaths every weekend.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;\
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;What about school?&quot; you ask. &quot;I can&#39;t go like this, can I?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;That&#39;s a good point,&quot; he says, rubbing the white stubble on his chin. &quot;I tell you what. I can write the school a note that will excuse you from your gym classes. Would that do the trick?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Oh, yes please, sir.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Good,&quot; he says, getting out his notepad. &quot;You just take this with you and show it to your teachers. They can call me if they have any questions. I won&#39;t //tell// them anything,&quot; he adds, seeing the look on your face. &quot;Not unless you want me to.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; he says, shaking his head and sucking his front teeth. &quot;You wouldn&#39;t be able to keep that kind of secret from your parents. Otherwise, what would you wear? Would you change clothes along the way somehow? And the school would have to know why the //real// you has stopped going, otherwise they&#39;d be sure to send a truant officer to talk to your parents and ask why you aren&#39;t at school. If that&#39;s what you prefer, I suppose I can&#39;t stop you, but I don&#39;t know how long you&#39;d get away with a scheme like that. It would fall apart in a day or two, I think. I don&#39;t advise that you try it.&quot; Without waiting for a response, he begins packing his black bag and prepares to leave. &quot;In fact, if you&#39;re going to try a scheme like that, I&#39;d prefer not to know about it.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;&lt;if $page == 10&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I won&#39;t tell the school anything, unless you ask me to,&quot; Dr Bennett assures you. &quot;It&#39;s part of the Hippocratic Oath. The World Medical Association in Geneva just issued a statement about secrecy, only this year. As a doctor, I don&#39;t say any more than is necessary.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Oh, good.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Of course, if I discover that what you have is some kind of communicable disease, and there are other people at risk,&quot; Dr Bennett says, beginning to pack his black bag, &quot;then I would have to tell the King County board of health. But I wouldn&#39;t worry about that right now. Let me look into this condition of yours first, and I&#39;ll let you know what I find out.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Yes, that&#39;s true,&quot; $fr says. &quot;You could &lt;&lt;if $startsex == &quot;female&quot;&gt;&gt;do all kinds of boy things, like be a doctor, or join the Army or something.&quot;&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;do all kinds of girl things, like be a teacher or be Miss America or something.&quot;&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;But it&#39;s not that funny, when you think about it. If there&#39;s no cure and you&#39;re like this //forever,// well, that&#39;s something to think about. Is it worth it?&lt;/div&gt;

Mom picked up the line upstairs. What&#39;s shaking?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I was thinking about what you said today,&quot; you say, your heart pounding. &quot;About trying to make out. And about seeing if anything happens. You know. To me. D&#39;you want to?&quot; It comes blurting out more awkwardly than you could have imagined.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Me?&quot; $fr asks, perplexed.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Well, yeah,&quot; you say. It&#39;s a good thing he can&#39;t see how red you&#39;re turning. &quot;I mean, you&#39;re a boy, still, and I&#39;m ... I&#39;m not, and &lt;&lt;if $path.includes(&quot;SO informed&quot;)&gt;&gt;I just thought $so wouldn&#39;t want to, so...&quot;&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;I haven&#39;t said anything to $so yet, so...&quot;&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; You trail off.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Hmm,&quot; $fr says, thinking it over. &quot;Sure, I guess so. I probably ... I mean, it&#39;s not like ...&quot; He stops. &quot;Where were you thinking? Maybe ... you want to go to the park? Lots of couples make out over there. Nobody would notice. Maybe tomorrow night?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Sure,&quot; you say. For some reason, it sounds deeply exciting. Naughty. Dangerous. You start to get a funny feeling in the pit of your stomach — no, lower than that. Kissing $fr on the lips. In the park. &quot;Tomorrow night? Sure.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Oh, there&#39;s one thing,&quot; he adds. &quot;You&#39;re going to have to dress like a girl. Otherwise it&#39;ll look funny, y&#39;know?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;elseif $startsex == &quot;female&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Hey,&quot; you say. &quot;It&#39;s good to talk to you.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Her response is a little puzzled. &quot;It&#39;s good to talk to you, too. What&#39;s up?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I was thinking about what you said earlier,&quot; you stammer. &quot;About trying it again, to see if anything happens. I think it&#39;s a good idea. What do you say to you and me going down to the park and trying it out a little?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;You and me?&quot; $fr asks, interested. She lowers her voice to a whisper. &quot;Do you mean ... making out?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Well, yeah,&quot; you reply. The idea is very intriguing. You&#39;ve never made out with a girl before, and $fr is your best friend. Why not?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Just like that?&quot; $fr asks. &quot;I thought you had a boyfriend. You&#39;ve been writing letters to me about him all summer.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I just figured he wouldn&#39;t want to do it,&quot; you explain. &lt;&lt;if $openzeta == true&gt;&gt;&quot;He was a bit surprised when I showed up in band class.&quot;&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;&quot;I haven&#39;t really told him yet, anyway.&quot;&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Why me?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I thought if I should be making out with any girl, it should be you,&quot; you say. &quot;You know, for my first time.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;That&#39;s sweet,&quot; $fr says. &quot;All right. Pick me up tomorrow night. We&#39;ll go to the park. And dress like a boy, okay? I don&#39;t want anyone thinking we&#39;re two //girls// smooching behind the statues. A girl could get a reputation that way.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;

From 1930 to 1938, a researcher named Horace Kind attempted to produce a polio vaccine, using as test subjects a number of high school students in the area of King County, Washington. These experiments were ultimately unsuccessful in preventing polio, but they had an unexpected side effect. The children of those vaccine test subjects were born with a new kind of dimorphic sex chromosome, designated Z or Zeta.

The Zeta chromosome can transform its shape and chemical nature from X to Y and back, changing an XX into an XY pair, or vice-versa. It rarely does so when this would result in a non-viable combination, such as YY, although this is mostly because I (the author) don&#39;t want to complicate things unnecessarily. Some other author who is better versed in genetics can tackle this variation.

What the Zeta chromosome actually _does_ apart from change biological sex is up to the player. The intention is to permit the player to play through each of the scenarios and keep track of the player&#39;s decisions. The changes wrought by the Zeta chromosome and the way these affect society depend on what the player chooses.

THE CHOICES
There are five basic axes along which the player&#39;s choices matter. Major decisions from each story are added to the saved calculations, which persist across multiple playthroughs. (The player will have the option to wipe the history and start fresh.)

* Sex. Does the Zeta chromosome only affect AFAB or AMAB? If the player always selects &quot;male&quot; to start, then Zeta becomes a condition only of children born and identified as male at birth. The choice of starting character could become constrained to that single sex. If the player chooses a mixture of male and female starting points, the game will allow both AMAB and AFAB characters to be Zetas.

* Social. Does society accept or reject these changes? If the player is more open, more forthright, more bold, and more accepting of the changes, society will shift in that direction. Zetas will get more good publicity as role models emerge on early radio and newsreels, and later in the golden age of television. If the player is more secretive or shameful about these changes, and pushes less against the grain, then society will have a less-good view of Zetas; and Zetas of the future are more likely to conceal their natures or face consequences. The world thus becomes the kind of place that the player creates.

* Orientation. Does the Zeta chromosome change your orientation or sex drive? If the player chooses to engage in new sexual behaviors (for instance, going from hetero male to hetero female), then at least sometimes the Zeta chromosome makes this happen. If the player chooses to remain with one sexuality (eg, hetero male to lesbian female) then the Zeta chromosome is _not_ known for changing orientation. The game will keep track of how often this happens and make assumptions about later characters&#39; sexuality.

* Mental. Does the Zeta chromosome change the way people think? Is the brain itself altered, setting aside matters of orientation? Do Zetas think differently in each state?

* Procreation. Since a Zeta always changes during sex, it makes normal methods of proliferation for the Z chromosome impossible. Therefore, one of two methods must be favored. Either the chromosome is _transmissible_ (you can catch Zeta from somewhere), or the chromosome is _lockable_ (your form can be fixed in one state somehow, either temporarily or permanently).

All of the above contribute to the kind of world the player creates. If Zetas are looked down upon, and the state is Lockable, then Zetas may try to fix themselves in a favored shape. If Zetas are disfavored and the condition can be caught, then the condition might be inflicted on others out of spite, and transgender people may secretly aspire to catch the condition. And so on.

THE ZETA WAVES

Nobody seems to take much notice of you, which is good, but it&#39;s still a little creepy to realize that people you know don&#39;t seem to recognize you at all. There&#39;s not a single friendly wave, not a single smile, no nods of recognition, no little moments of friendly eye contact. You&#39;re a stranger.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;The principal&#39;s office is a quiet little nest of interconnected offices with a tall counter up front and several desks arranged behind where secretaries answer phones, go over paperwork, and speak with other new students -- like you, apparently.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Eventually, one of the secretaries finds you at the counter. You recognize her as Mrs Decker, the mother of one of the $girlsboys[$oppgen] in your scout troop. &quot;Can I help you?&quot; she asks you, with a polite, blank smile.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;if $openzeta == true&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I&#39;m here for my schedule,&quot; you say quietly. &quot;I&#39;m $name. We called and talked to the principal last night.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;if $sex == &quot;female&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Mrs Decker blinks in surprise, taking in your makeup, your wig, your yellow cardigan, and your frilly blue dress. &quot;Oh! Oh, yes, Mr Fordyce said—&quot; She shakes her head. &quot;I&#39;m sorry, I didn&#39;t recognize you at all. Well, I wouldn&#39;t, would I?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;elseif $sex == &quot;male&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Mrs Decker blinks in surprise, taking in your boyishly short haircut, your slacks, your blazer, and your broader physique. &quot;Oh! Oh, yes, Mr Fordyce said—&quot; She shakes her head. &quot;I&#39;m sorry, I didn&#39;t recognize you at all. Well, I wouldn&#39;t, would I?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;\
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I am a //little// different,&quot; you concede. &quot;It&#39;s this condition I have.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Does it have a name? What happened?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I&#39;m not sure, ma&#39;am,&quot; you say. &quot;We&#39;ll find out when I see Dr Bennett on Monday.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Well, come around to my desk,&quot; Mrs Decker says, folding up part of the countertop to allow you through. &quot;Let&#39;s get your schedule sorted out.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
--[[follow her behind the counter|1948 Principal][$page to 1]]
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I&#39;m here for my schedule,&quot; you say awkwardly. &quot;I just enrolled yesterday.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Mrs Decker nods at you, smiling gently. &quot;Very good. Let me get your card and I&#39;ll show you which classes your mother asked to sign you up for.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
--[[wait for her to retrieve your card|1948 Principal][$page to 2]]

&lt;&lt;if $page == 1&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You go behind the counter. Mrs Decker folds the countertop back down behind you and leads over to her desk. There&#39;s a wooden chair with an uncomfortable slatted back beside her desk, and she directs you to sit.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;No, no, dear,&quot; she admonishes you, seeing the way you seat yourself. &lt;&lt;if $sex == &quot;female&quot;&gt;&gt;&quot;Knees together. And hook your ankles together. That&#39;s more ladyl—er, I mean,&quot; she says, hesitating, &quot;you should try to look ladylike.&quot;&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;&quot;Unbutton the blazer when you sit down, or it&#39;ll just look rumpled and untidy. That&#39;s how a gentleman would—I mean,&quot; she says, hesitating, &quot;now that you //are// one, you should try to look the part.&quot;&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;She turns her attention to some long typewritten forms that have been placed under the heavy glass surface of her desk. &quot;Here we are. First semester, 1948. Let&#39;s see...&quot; She compares the list to your hand-written student schedule card in her other hand.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You crane your neck to look.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Mrs Decker whips a pencil out from behind her ear and starts to make notes on your student card. &quot;Well, Mr $lastname — I mean Miss $lastname — er, $name, you know. Or $oppname. How very confusing this is!&quot; She looks flustered. &quot;We&#39;ll have to change some of your classes around, but I think we can manage to devise a schedule for you that fits your current condition.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;She pushes your altered student card across the table. It&#39;s a half-sheet of thick cardstock with a pre-printed grid: classes down the left side, and space for grades across the middle.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;if $sex == &quot;female&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;We&#39;ll have to take you out of second period Gym class,&quot; she says, pointing at the card with her pencil. &quot;Normally, the state requries you to take some kind of physical fitness class, but there //are// alternatives. I&#39;ve written in Pep Squad for you, which is third period. That&#39;s one of the classes they allow us to use instead.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Pep Squad?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Oh, yes,&quot; she says. &quot;You&#39;ll love it. There&#39;s dance and choreography, and you do drills and routines with the marching band, you perform at the football games. It&#39;s very physical. A lot of girls your age—&quot; She falters. &quot;Well, anyway. It&#39;s co-ed, so there are some boys in the class too, but there&#39;s no worries about locker rooms or anything, so Mr Fordyce should approve.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Is there a uniform?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Not for every day, just for game days. Now, since Pep Squad is third period, we had to take you out of History and put you in second-period Stenography instead. That&#39;s for taking shorthand, which is very useful for young ladies to know.&quot; She shows you some squiggles on a steno pad. &quot;And your seventh-period class, Wood Shop, Mr Fordyce and $shop decided there might be too much lifting and carrying of wood and boards and so on, and you might prefer that we switch you into $homeec&#39;s Home Economics class.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I thought boys didn&#39;t have to take Home Economics.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Normally, no,&quot; Mrs Decker says apologetically, &quot;but it isn&#39;t just baking cookies and sewing dresses any more. There&#39;s some home repair, too. Knowing how to fix your home appliances. You&#39;ll like it. And there&#39;s those other home skills, too, and I think every girl should—&quot; She stops, with a polite but confused cough. &quot;At any rate, I think that will do nicely.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;display &quot;NextClassLink&quot;&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;elseif $sex == &quot;male&quot;&gt;&gt;&quot;We&#39;ll have to take you out of third period Gym class,&quot; she says, pointing at the card with her pencil. &quot;Normally, the state requires you to take some kind of physical fitness class, but there //are// alternatives. I&#39;ve written in Marching Band for you, which is secnd period. That&#39;s one of the classes they allow us to use instead.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Marching Band?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Oh, yes,&quot; she says. &quot;You&#39;ll love it. The band has a drum corps, and they&#39;re always looking for boys—&quot; She falters. &quot;Well, anyway. It&#39;s co-ed, so there are some girls in the class too, but there&#39;s no worries about locker rooms or anything, so Mr Fordyce should approve.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Is there a uniform?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Not for every day, just for game days. Now, since Marching Band is second period, we had to take you out of Stenography and put you in third-period History instead. $hist is a very good instructor, and he teaches a lot of military history, which a lot of the boys in his class seem to like.&quot; She goes down the list. &quot;And your seventh-period Home Economics course, well, $homeec thought you might be a distraction to the girls in there, so we&#39;ve decided you&#39;d do better in Wood Shop with $shop.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I thought girls weren&#39;t allowed to take Wood Shop.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Oh, they are,&quot; Mrs Decker says breezily, &quot;it just doesn&#39;t happen very often. Most young ladies don&#39;t grow up to be carpenters, you see. That&#39;s more of a job for young men like you, who—&quot; She stops, with a polite but confused cough. &quot;At any rate, I think that will do nicely.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;

Third period, history with $hist. He&#39;s very good. $hist teaches a lot of military history, which you should like. Then Vocal Music, fourth period, and then lunch. The cafeteria is just up those steps you see outside, through the doors, turn right at the trophy cabinet, and left through the commons. Ask one of the other boys, they&#39;ll be able to tell you the right way to go.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;After lunch, you&#39;ll have Spanish. Then sixth-period Geometry, and finally Wood Shop. A lot of young men these days are going into building, so you&#39;ll learn some useful skills there, I&#39;m sure.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;

That&#39;s a very useful course for young ladies, for taking fast notes and so on. Then third period Gym, and the girls are starting swimming for the first four weeks. After Gym you&#39;ll go to Vocal Music, then lunch. The cafeteria is through the big green front doors just outside.

		Note: CROSS does not tell us whether the player&#39;s Zeta
		condition is *known.* It only tells us whether the player
		is dressed as the &quot;other&quot; sex at the moment (eg, started
		male, turned female, wearing women&#39;s clothes).
		
		CROSS could be true if:
			a) the player is an OPEN ZETA and openly going about as
			the opposite sex; or
			b) the player has a NEW ID.
	&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;
	

	
	PUSSYBOY and DICKGIRL schedules mean the school knows, the class
	knows, and the player has been given a customized schedule with
	minimal but necessary disruptions.
	
	BOY and GIRL schedules mean the player is attending a schedule
	that is based on zir CURRENT sex.
		with CROSS: new identity for the current (eg, opposite) sex
		no CROSS: old identity for the starting sex
		
	SECRET GIRL and BOY schedules mean the school is not aware, but
	the parents and/or doctor have given special dispensation to avoid
	certain classes where there is a threat of discovery (eg, gym).
	
	The schedule type will be set DAILY to account for transformations.
	It is being set once here, along with other variables, just to
	begin with.

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;The teacher, $band, a stout red-faced man with a thick mustache, speaks to you privately before class. &quot;I understand, Mr $lastname, that you are new to the band this year, and are switching over from Gym class. Is that right?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Yes, sir,&quot; you say.&lt;/div&gt;

I have to sign off on your performance. If I find you are simply here to skip Gym, I won&#39;t sign your transfer and you&#39;ll be back in the locker room. You&#39;ll have to find something else.

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Good. Now I&#39;m going to start you on the bass drum to begin with. We have a spare that belongs to the school. Do you read music?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;A little. I&#39;ve been taking Vocal Music for a few years.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Good. It shouldn&#39;t be hard for you to follow along. Let&#39;s see how you do with the bass drum for a few weeks, and if you show some rhythm and aptitude, we can try you on a snare drum.&quot;&lt;/div&gt; 
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Marvin Long, the other bass drummer in the marching band, helps you strap on the big bass drum, adjusting the straps for you. &quot;You&#39;ll want it to be comfortable,&quot; he says. &quot;It can get tiresome to carry around after a while, so make sure it fits you.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Yeah, yeah, I can understand that. Good,&quot; he adds, more to himself. &quot;Okay, then I&#39;ll see you tonight?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;There&#39;s an unspoken question in there, which you decide to answer. &quot;It&#39;s still going,&quot; you say firmly. &quot;Same as before.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;He nods miserably. &quot;Look, I&#39;m sorry I flipped out a little yesterday. I didn&#39;t know what else to say.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;We&#39;ll have to talk later.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Yeah, that&#39;s cool,&quot; he says, his attention wandering back to the brass and woodwind musicians oomphing away in two-four time. &quot;Well, I guess I&#39;d better get back.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;You probably should.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Maybe I could call you? Some time this weekend, maybe?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;\
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Then $music calls your name, and you have to go get measured. &quot;Yeah. Talk to you later!&quot; you say.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Yeah, sure,&quot; $so says, and returns to band practice.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;elseif $secret == true&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;set $path.push(&quot;stuffing tease&quot;)&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;It&#39;s in between the reeds and the drums that the absolute worst happens.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;if $path.includes(&quot;sock stuffing&quot;)&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You&#39;re the first one to get measured, and you&#39;re discreetly trying to adjust your trousers so everything looks normal. These trousers are a little snug around the crotch, and your sock stuffing isn&#39;t holding in place. Then there&#39;s an ominous twang and a little whipping sensation against your inner thigh, and you can feel your makeshift penis slipping down your trouser leg.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Ron Zimmerman, the saxophonist, looks down at the sock falling out of your trouser leg. &quot;What&#39;s that?&quot; he asks.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Then Gerald Myers, the red-headed class clown, notices the sock sitting on your loafer and makes the connection. &quot;Oh, shit!&quot; he exclaims loudly, pointing. &quot;$name stuffs his pants!&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You&#39;re the first one to get measured, and you&#39;re discreetly trying to adjust your trousers so everything looks normal. These trousers are a little snug around the crotch, and there&#39;s no mistaking the absence of any male equipment down there. Why didn&#39;t you stuff your trousers?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Underwear too tight?&quot; asks Ron Zimmerman, the saxophonist. &quot;I hate that.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Yeah,&quot; jokes Gerald Myers. He&#39;s a red-headed class clown who thinks he&#39;s much funnier than he really is. &quot;It&#39;s so tight you can see his—&quot; But he stops and stares. &quot;Shit, you can&#39;t even see his balls!&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;\
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;The loud cry and the shocking expletive make half the people in the band turn to look. &quot;Language!&quot; calls $music, and $band angrily taps his baton for tempo.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;What&#39;s the matter, didn&#39;t your balls drop yet?&quot; Gerald jokes. &quot;Because you don&#39;t seem to be packing any.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Quit staring at his dick, you pervert!&quot; Ronald says, to which Gerald replies &quot;//What// dick?&quot; and $music says &quot;Language, I said!&quot; again.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Then $music has come around the table and grabbed both of them by the ear. &quot;All right, you two, come with me,&quot; she says. Her usual demeanor of frazzled, good-natured charm has vanished, and she looks angry. &quot;We&#39;re going to see Mr Fordyce and tell him about your potty mouths.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Great. There&#39;s no way Gerald will keep his big mouth shut. Now it&#39;ll be all over the whole school.&lt;/div&gt;

In impulse, you stop one of the girls leaving Stenography and ask. It&#39;s one of the Morris triplets: Jean or Jane or June, you can&#39;t tell which. &quot;Excuse me, do you know where the Pep Squad meets?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Oh, sure,&quot; she says happily. &quot;Follow me!&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;It turns out the pep squad meets in the gymnasium, where a number of bleachers had been unfolded from the wall. All the girls — and one boy — are sitting on the bleachers. The triplet who led you here, whichever one it was, joins her sisters on the lowest bench, where they huddle their heads and giggle about something.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;The class is under the instruction of a youthful, athletic woman named $pep, who is so slender and has such muscular calves that she practically floats on air when she walks. She&#39;s very lean and has a no-nonsense attitude.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Welcome to Pep Squad, ladies,&quot; she says briskly, adding, &quot;//and// gentleman. We have a cheer king on the squad, at last. The first one I&#39;ve seen since before the war. Well done. Thanks for joining us.&quot; She holds up her hands to still the sudden rush of tittering conversation. &quot;Girls, girls. Before 1939, cheerleaders were //all// men. Until the draft. They all went away to war, and that left open some space for we ladies to take over. Let&#39;s all be welcoming to Mr Bailey, shall we?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Floyd Bailey essayed a little wave from the front row of the bleachers.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Now as I&#39;m sure you know,&quot; $pep goes on, &quot;this is a substitute for your regular Gym class, but it is not open to any and all. There isn&#39;t the space. Instead, I will be evaluating each of you during the first few weeks of class for enthusiasm, ability, balance, poise, and participation. Those of you who do not make the Pep Squad will have to go back to your regular physical education class, or find a new alternative. Is that clear to everyone?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Everybody nods, especially you. It&#39;s hard to imagine showing up in your regular Gym class and getting undressed in front of all the $girlsboys[$oppgen] there. You //can// imagine the teasing that would follow, however.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Excellent,&quot; $pep says. &quot;All right, I&#39;m going to go down my list. When you hear your name, call out &#39;present!&#39;&quot;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;&lt;set _lst to [$lastname, &quot;Lenford&quot;]&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;set _lst to _lst.sort()&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;if _lst[0] == $lastname&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;set _first to 0&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;set _first to 1&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;if $openzeta == true&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;set $path.push(&quot;SO informed&quot;)&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;if _first == 0&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;As $pep calls out your name, you hear a squeal from the crowd of girls. &quot;My goodness,&quot; a voice says. &quot;$name? I didn&#39;t know //you// were doing Pep Squad this year!&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;elseif _first == 1&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;When $pep calls out &#39;$so Lenford&#39; you aren&#39;t really paying attention, but then she announces //your// name and there&#39;s a sudden squeal from the crowd of girls. &quot;My goodness,&quot; a voice says. &quot;$name? I didn&#39;t know //you// were doing Pep Squad this year!&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;\
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;But then $sonick //sees// you in your frilly blue dress and stockings and your yellow cardigan, and her mouth falls open. &quot;What are you doing?&quot; she asks in a scandalized voice. &quot;You&#39;re dressed like a — a —&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Oh!&quot; one of the Morris triplets, sitting right beside $so, tugs urgently at her hand. &quot;I forgot to tell you! $name is in Stenography with me. I should have said!&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;//Stenography?//&quot; $so asks blankly. &quot;Are you sure, Jean? That&#39;s for girls!&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I&#39;m sure,&quot; Jean says happily. &quot;We just came from there together.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Ladies, please,&quot; $pep says. &quot;I&#39;m taking roll. You can visit after class.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;elseif $openzeta == false&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;set $newknowns to [28]&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;display &quot;NewKnowns&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You wait for your name to be called out. $pep reads it, and you respond with &#39;present.&#39;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Oh, hey,&quot; says a girl in the front called Judith Young. &quot;Good to see you again! I didn&#39;t know you were doing Pep Squad this year.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;It&#39;s kind of a last-minute decision,&quot; you say weakly.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;\
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;$pep gets everybody on the gym floor doing warm-up stretches. She demonstrates each one at the front of the group, delivering stern warnings about what happens to girls who don&#39;t stretch properly before athletic activity. &quot;You could get hurt, so pay attention,&quot; she says. &quot;If you pull a muscle, you won&#39;t be able to perform at the games.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;It takes all of the first lesson to go over stretching exercises and safety rules. &quot;From now on, when you girls get to class, I want you to start right away on stretches. Don&#39;t wait for me. I want us to be ready to go as soon as possible, so we get the maximum amount of time.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;if $openzeta == true&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;After class, $so corners you, with the Morris triplets backing her up. &quot;How come you didn&#39;t tell me you were coming to class like this?&quot; she asks irritably.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I heard $nom[$oppgen] has some kind of condition,&quot; one of the triplets says from behind her.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Yes, June, me too,&quot; says another. &quot;It&#39;s so something new, the doctors don&#39;t even know what it is. You never know who it&#39;s going to be next!&quot; She looks gleefully wicked for a moment, then calms herself down. &quot;At least that&#39;s what Alice Whitfield told me.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;$so stares hard at you, torn between shock and sympathy. &quot;Is this true?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;More or less,&quot; you say. &quot;I woke up like this yesterday morning.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Yesterday //morning//?&quot; she demands. &lt;&lt;if $path.includes(&quot;shameful TG&quot;)&gt;&gt;&quot;Is that why you were out sick on the first day of school, when I //know// you weren&#39;t sick the night before?&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;&quot;Is that why you didn&#39;t come find me on the first day of school?&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; Why didn&#39;t you call me? You should have said something.&quot; She sticks her chin out at you stubbornly.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Yesterday was ... really a bad day,&quot; you say. &quot;I&#39;m so sorry, $so, I really am, but there was so much going on.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;All right, I suppose.&quot; She looks at you with lingering suspicion.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Maybe should talk about it later,&quot; you say. &quot;Call you tonight?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;At last, $so relents. She gives you a brief hug and a peck on the cheek. &quot;All right. Tonight, right after dinner?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;\
&lt;&lt;display &quot;NextClassLink&quot;&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;\
&lt;&lt;if $day == 4&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;After completing warm-ups for the day, $pep claps her hands. &quot;All right, most of you can probably guess what we&#39;re doing today. It&#39;s time to find a partner and get measured for uniforms, the same as every year. I have cloth tape measures here on this table! I have lists of measurements we need! If anybody doesn&#39;t know how to measure yourself, don&#39;t ask your neighbor -- ask me. We have to get the uniforms right for the first game and there&#39;s no time to send any back to the seamstress for adjustments.&quot; Over her shoulder, she says to &lt;&lt;if $sched == &quot;dickgirl schedule&quot;&gt;&gt;you and Floyd,&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;Floyd,&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; &quot;If you don&#39;t know how to measure an inseam, just let me do it. It&#39;ll be faster.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Can we change in the locker room?&quot; one of the girls asks. She&#39;s got on a bulky sweater and a floucy scarf.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;No, just change out here,&quot; the teacher says briskly. &quot;You don&#39;t have time to go all that way. When we&#39;re visiting another school, we may not have the luxury of changing in separate rooms, so you might as well get used to it. For now, just strip off that heavy sweater. Anything bulky you have on, take it off. You&#39;re not going to be wearing your uniform //over// your sweaters, girls.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Do we get //new// uniforms this year?&quot; asks one of the Morris triplets.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;No, Jean, I&#39;m afraid we&#39;re still using the ones from last year and making adjustments,&quot; $pep replies. &quot;All right, get together with your partners and come get a tape measure!&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;if $openzeta == true&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You pair up with $so, bringing her a cloth tape measure and an extra sheet for her measurements.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;She gives you a long look before finally taking it out of your hand. &quot;Thanks.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;You&#39;re welcome.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Here, give me both of them, I&#39;ll put in our names.&quot; $so focuses on the worksheet for a few moments before speaking again. There&#39;s something bright and brittle about the way she&#39;s speaking, as if she&#39;s determined to maintain control of herself. &quot;There. Are you ready?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;if $path.includes(&quot;SO date&quot;)&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You can tell that something&#39;s wrong, so you say, &quot;I&#39;m sorry, I know this must be hard on you too.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Well, yes it is,&quot; $so says, and her brow furrows. &quot;A lot of girls are asking me if I&#39;m some kind of lezzie or something, and I don&#39;t even know what that //is.// I bet it&#39;s something unkind.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; you say again. &quot;I didn&#39;t mean for this to happen.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I know you didn&#39;t,&quot; she says, giving you a hug. &quot;If they think they&#39;re going to stop me being your girlfriend over a word like that, they&#39;re wrong. I&#39;m more determined than ever. We&#39;re going on that date, and I&#39;m kissing you, even if you //are// practically a girl right now. If there&#39;s a way to turn you back to normal, we&#39;ll find it.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;For a moment, you feel like you might choke up with tears. But you force a smile and say, &quot;Thanks, that means a lot to me right now.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;elseif $path.includes(&quot;date revealed&quot;)&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I&#39;m ready,&quot; you say, looking at her with concern. &quot;Are you okay? I&#39;m sorry, I know this must be hard on you too.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Well, it is, yes,&quot; $so says, and she tries to clear her furrowed brow with a smile. &quot;Are you and $fr still ... doing that thing tonight?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Yes, as far as I know.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Good. I&#39;m glad. I hope it works.&quot; She touches your arm briefly, then draws it back. &quot;Anyway, I have some clothes for you that I can drop off right after school.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;For a moment, you feel like you might choke up with tears. But you force a smile and say, &quot;That will be very helpful. Thanks for being so understanding.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;elseif $path.includes(&quot;SO helping on date&quot;)&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I&#39;m ready,&quot; you say, looking at her with concern. &quot;Are you okay? I&#39;m sorry, I know this must be hard on you too.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Well, it is, yes,&quot; $so says, and she tries to clear her furrowed brow with a smile. &quot;Do you still want me to bring some clothes over for you?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Yes, please,&quot; you say.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;All right, then. I will.&quot; She touches your arm briefly, then draws it back. &quot;I&#39;ll just drop them off right after school. You&#39;ll be home then, right?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Yes, I will.&quot; For a moment, you feel like you might choke up with tears. But you force a smile and say, &quot;That will be very helpful. Thanks for being so understanding.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You can tell that something&#39;s wrong, so you say, &quot;I&#39;m sorry. Is there something I can do?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Yes,&quot; she says frostily. &quot;You can turn back into a boy, that&#39;s what you can do.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&lt;&lt;if $path.includes(&quot;friend date&quot;)&gt;&gt;&quot;I&#39;m trying,&quot; you say, thinking of your date with $fr tonight.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;&quot;I don&#39;t know how,&quot; you protest.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;You just better figure it out,&quot; she says. &quot;Do you know what the other girls are calling me behind my back? I don&#39;t even know what some of those words //mean.// They can be so cruel.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I will, I promise,&quot; you say. //Somehow,// you add, but only to yourself.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;&lt;elseif $secret == true&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;set $path.push(&quot;stuffing tease&quot;)&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You partner up with a pretty girl named Judith Young. She&#39;s already fetched a tape measure and two sheets of paper. Then, inevitably, the worst happens.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;if $path.includes(&quot;bra stuffing&quot;)&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Sweaters off!&quot; $pep says as she passes by you. &quot;If it&#39;s bulky, take it off!&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You pull your knit sweater off over your head, feeling how snug it is around your wider shoulders, and shake out your hair. Something is wrong, because Judith is pointing toward your collar. &quot;Um, $name, there&#39;s some toilet tissue there...&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;It&#39;s true. The stuffing you added to your bra has come unraveled, and is now sticking out of your collar. Feeling your face turn bright red, you turn away from the others and try to stuff it back in before anybody sees.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;But it&#39;s too late. Jane Morris sees it and points toward you, with a delighted laugh. &quot;Oh my!&quot; she says, beaming. &quot;$name stuffs her bra!&quot; and her sisters turn their heads to look, too.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;What?&quot; Floyd asks, confused. &quot;You mean $name hasn&#39;t got any boobs at all?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Sweaters off!&quot; $pep says as she passes by you. &quot;If it&#39;s bulky, take it off!&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You pull your knit sweater off over your head, feeling how snug it is around your wider shoulders, and shake out your hair. There&#39;s something wrong, because your middle feels chilly. Then you realize that you pulled up your blouse as well as your shirt, and Judith is frowning at you, her gaze fixed on the flattened cups of your bra. &quot;Um, $pep, I don&#39;t think $name //has// any measurements.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Of course, it&#39;s true, but you don&#39;t want anyone to know that. You try to disentangle your blouse from your sweater and get everything put back in place before anybody notices.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;But it&#39;s too late. Jane Morris sees it and points toward you, with a delighted laugh. &quot;Oh my!&quot; she says, beaming. &quot;$name is flat as a board!&quot; and her sisters turn their heads to look, too.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;What?&quot; Floyd asks, confused. &quot;You mean $name hasn&#39;t got any boobs at all?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Oh, great. There&#39;s no way the Pep Squad girls will keep their mouths shut about //this.// It&#39;ll be all over the school before long.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;That&#39;s right,&quot; Ray gloats at the two girls. &quot;You stink. Go find some other team!&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;That&#39;s not very nice, Ray,&quot; Harold says mildly.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You go up to $eng&#39;s desk to see what scenes are available. Unfortunately, there&#39;s only one. It says: &quot;Act IV, Scene i. Rosalind, disguised as a shepherd named Ganymede, tries to teach Orlando about love by __pretending__ to be Rosalind and asking Celia to marry them.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Aw, fiddlesticks!&quot; grumbles Ray when he sees the list. &quot;It&#39;s a love scene. I //knew// nobody was going to want to do that one.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;You could be Jaques,&quot; Doris points out. &quot;He leaves on the first page.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Then I don&#39;t get no lines at all.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Celia doesn&#39;t have many lines.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Celia&#39;s a //girl,//&quot; says Ray in a withering voice.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Fine, then,&quot; you say, fed up with Ray&#39;s complaints. &quot;You can be Rosalind, the girl pretending to be a boy pretending to be a girl. Or you can be Orlando, the man who falls in love with her.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Orlando&#39;s the hero?&quot; he asks, his eyes narrowing suspiciously. &quot;All right, I&#39;ll be Orlando.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;What part do you want?&quot; Harold asks Doris politely.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;She looks at him blankly. &quot;What do you mean? Celia is the only girl left.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;And you?&quot; Harold asks, looking to you. &lt;&lt;if $openzeta == true&gt;&gt;&quot;Maybe you should play Rosalind, given ... you know, your condition.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;You&#39;d be better at playing Rosalind than me, I bet.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; But I will, if you&#39;d rather be Jaques. It doesn&#39;t matter to me.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Well, sucks to you, too,&quot; Ray mutters, leading Harold away.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;This will be excellent,&quot; Alice says happily. &quot;I&#39;ll be the director, of course. I know this show backwards. We should all try to memorize our parts, don&#39;t you think? And I bet we could find some costumes, too.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Let&#39;s just pick a scene first,&quot; Arlene says, irritated. &quot;Before they&#39;re all gone.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You go up to $eng&#39;s desk to see what scenes are available. Unfortunately, there&#39;s only one. It says: &quot;Act IV, Scene i. Rosalind, disguised as a shepherd named Ganymede, tries to teach Orlando about love by __pretending__ to be Rosalind and asking Celia to marry them.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Nobody took this scene? It&#39;s the best scene!&quot; Alice signs her name on the page as group leader. &quot;Except maybe the scene with Jacques, //all the world&#39;s a stage,// that&#39;s a good one. Now I&#39;ve already played Celia before, and I&#39;m //dying// to play Rosalind, &lt;&lt;if $openzeta == true&gt;&gt;but maybe $currname should do that, given $poss[$gen] condition. How&#39;s that?&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;but I&#39;ll do Celia again if someone else wants Rosalind.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; Anyone?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;There&#39;s &lt;&lt;if ($openzeta == true and $sex == &quot;male&quot;) or ($newid == true and $sex == &quot;male&quot;) or ($secret == true and $sex == &quot;female&quot;)&gt;&gt;three&lt;&lt;set _fcount to 3&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;four&lt;&lt;set _fcount to 4&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; girls here,&quot; Doris points out. &quot;And two parts for boys.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Oh, that&#39;s true,&quot; Alice says, with a look of sudden inspiration. &quot;$eng could hardly complain if I play Jaques. Or Orlando, even.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Why would you want to play a boy&#39;s part?&quot; Arlene asks acidly.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Well, one of us has to play a boy,&quot; Alice says, brushing the matter aside. &quot;As director, I nominate Doris to play Celia, &lt;&lt;if _fcount == 3&gt;&gt;$currname to play Orlando, Arlene to play Rosalind,&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;$currname to play Rosalind, Arlene to play Orlando,&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; and I&#39;ll be Jaques.
