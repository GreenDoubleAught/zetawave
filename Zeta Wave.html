</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="3" name="Planning" tags="" position="200,50" size="100,100">There needs to be a master CYCLE passage that works for ALL stories.
	* CYCLE will track what day it is, what part of the day,
	  and which passages are to control events of that day.
	* Each story will have a list of passage names (such as &quot;1941-Day&quot;
	  or &quot;1965-Afterschool&quot;), so CYCLE can direct the game to refer
	  to whatever passages are required. Since not all stories will be
	  set in the same environment -- at work, at school -- each story can
	  thus have its own list of required passages. Stories can also share
	  passages for generic activities (eg, bathing, sleeping) or for
	  certain activities that must share mechanical effects on stats
	  (like working out). The &quot;Working Out&quot; passage from multiple eras
	  can refer to a single Working Out Calculation passage to keep the
	  code in one place.
	* This structure means CYCLE must have a single array that tracks
	  the list of passages, how long that list is, and where we are now.
	  However, it also means that we could (in theory) skip to a new
	  day-part by manually cycling that variable.
	  
There needs to be a SETUP passage for each era.
	* The SETUP passage will establish the list of passages that must
	  be consulted by CYCLE, as well as the starting date and any other
	  relevant details.

There must be a MASTER passage that controls access to the various eras.
	* The MASTER passage will check to see which passages are available
	  and establish links for the ones which are.
	* The MASTER passage may also link to the BOOK, which puts the
	  player&#39;s story into a medical context.
	  
There must be a BOOK which reflects the player&#39;s accumulated decisions and how they affect the future of the Zeta Wave phenomenon. The player can only refer to a BOOK passage after having completed the related scenario.
	* To keep track of the BOOK, I must have a shorthand for outcomes
	  that can be boiled down to a this-or-that variable. For instance,
	  75% of all the players&#39; playthroughs were MTF and ended up in
	  pregnancy, or 95% of all playthroughs changed sexual orientation,
	  or whatever.
	* The BOOK will not have any special interactivity to it, except to
	  be able to reset all the variables (with a warning that this will
	  start the game over from the beginning).

Sure enough, there&#39;s no cock to be found in there.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;One look at the front of your nightgown is enough. Sure enough, there&#39;s a cock down there.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You check your reflection in the mirror, and are relieved to find that you don&#39;t look //that// much different. &lt;&lt;if $sex == &quot;female&quot;&gt;&gt;Your hair is still boyishly short, your face is still youthful and somewhat good-looking, and — another peek — you don&#39;t have any girly tits or anything.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;Your hair is still the right medium length for a bob, your face is still youthful and pretty, and your figure is still slender. You never were all that developed anyway, not yet, so there isn&#39;t much to notice.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; But there&#39;s //something// there that&#39;s different, something subtle. Your eyelashes? Your ears? Your lips? A certain set of the shoulders? It&#39;s hard to say.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;//Okay, $name, don&#39;t flip your wig,// you tell yourself, breathing hard. //Something must have happened that—//&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You have a flash of memory. An image from the dream returns to mind. You and $so, sitting together on your bed...&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;&lt;elseif $path.includes(&quot;shameful TG&quot;)&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;The trouble with staying home from school, supposedly too ill to go, is that Mom will probably be here all day. You always hear her complaining about how much there is to do around the house: picking up after Pop and two kids, vacuuming, dusting, going shopping, baking, getting ready for dinner, and so on. She //might// be too busy to sneak upstairs and peek into your bedroom, but then again, she might not. That means you&#39;re going to have to look the part, just in case.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;As long as you stay in bed, you should be fine, but you know you can&#39;t hide here all day. You have to go downstairs, and soon, to ask $fr to collect your homework from your teachers. The minute you get up and go downstairs, Mom is going to notice something is wrong about you. &lt;&lt;if $startsex == &quot;male&quot;&gt;&gt;That gap between your thighs is going to be a problem. Your pajama bottoms don&#39;t do anything to conceal the fact that you&#39;re missing something important.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;That bulge between your thighs is going to be a problem. Your nightgown doesn&#39;t do anything to conceal the fact that you&#39;re packing some new equipment down there, or that you&#39;re missing a few things up top.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; You&#39;re going to need to do something about that.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&lt;&lt;if $startsex == &quot;male&quot;&gt;&gt;Luckily, you don&#39;t have any girly breasts or anything yet, so all you need is a strategic pair of socks.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;Luckily, all it takes is a little toilet tissue to fill out your bra, and a couple pairs of underwear and a girdle to hide the telltale lump.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You creep downstairs, holding your abdomen for theatrical effect, and go into the kitchen to use the telephone. After asking the operator ELliot-6251, you listen carefully for any telltale signs of breathing while $fr&#39;s number rings on the other end.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;At that moment, Mom walks into the kitchen and starts stirring up some Malt-O-Meal for $sibnick&#39;s breakfast. She ignores you, standing in your socks by the telephone, but it still makes you nervous.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Hello?&quot; It&#39;s $fr&#39;s mother.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Hello, Mrs Lenford,&quot; you say. &quot;Can I speak with $fr, please?&quot; You don&#39;t really want to dawdle in the kitchen under your mom&#39;s scrutiny, but you learned good telephone manners through scouting and you can&#39;t just stop now.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;In a minute, $fr comes on the line. &quot;Hello? $name?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Good, you haven&#39;t left for school yet,&quot; you say, and explain about the need for homework. &quot;Could you stop by my classes and pick it up, and then bring it by?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Why, what&#39;s wrong?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Mom is still stirring away at the stove, so you say, &quot;I&#39;m not feeling quite myself. A little under the weather. I&#39;ll tell you later.&quot; At a glance from your mother, you add, &quot;It&#39;s nothing important. I don&#39;t want to make you late for school.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;That seemed to do the trick. Now to go back to your room and try to figure out what&#39;s happening.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;It all fits pretty well, considering. The white underwear is much more comfortable for your cock than those tight panties you usually wear. The buttons are backward on the shirt, but you figure it all out except the tie, which you aren&#39;t sure how to wear. Fortunately, there&#39;s a section in the Girl Scout guide on knot-tying, so you look up a half-Windsor knot and figure it out yourself. It takes a couple of tries to get the length right, and you still have to tuck the end of the tie into your shirt so it doesn&#39;t stick out the bottom of the sweater.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You check yourself out in the mirror in the upstairs hallway. You look a little rumpled and confused, but not bad. Everything looks just right, except for the long hair. It&#39;s always //something,// isn&#39;t it?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Mom catches you in the hallway. A pair of silver scissors glints in her hand. &quot;All right,&quot; she says. &quot;Let&#39;s cut that hair.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Mom!&quot; you protest.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;You have to stick to the dress code,&quot; she says implacably. &quot;Now come downstairs and we&#39;ll get that trimmed off in a jiffy.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;elseif $cross == true and $sex == &quot;female&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;The outfit your mother chose for you is a pale blue dress with frilly white lace pockets on the skirt. There&#39;s also a pair of black patent-leather shoes, a yellow cardigan, and, of course, the inevitable: a white bra and an unfamiliar pair of panties.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You&#39;re wrestling with the bra when Mom knocks on your door again. &quot;Are you decent?&quot; she asks, sticking her head in.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Mom!&quot; you say, practically naked, wearing only panties, with your arms tangled in the bra straps. &quot;I thought you told $sib not to open doors like that.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I&#39;m your mother,&quot; she says, unperturbed, and points to the bed. &quot;Sit. I&#39;ve got to trim your toenails.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Why? Nobody&#39;s going to see them.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;You have to keep them trimmed or you&#39;ll get a run in your stockings.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Stockings?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;You heard me. The war&#39;s over. Ladies are wearing nylon stockings again. No more bare legs. Not for you, anyway — we&#39;ll talk about getting your legs shaved properly tonight. Now hold still and give me those toes.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;After trimming your toenails, Mom shows you how to roll up a pair of white stockings and unroll them up your legs. &quot;Now you do this one,&quot; she says, handing it to you. &quot;What have you //done// to this brassiere? It&#39;s all twisted into a — oh, there we go.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;After you get the stockings on, she womanhandles the bra onto your body. &quot;You don&#39;t need one, not really,&quot; she notes, &quot;but people will notice if you&#39;re not wearing one, trust me.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;But—&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;This was your idea,&quot; she reminds you. &quot;I&#39;m just trying to see that you&#39;re dressed for school. Now: arms up.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;She drops the dress over your head, and you wriggle into the short sleeve holes. &quot;I&#39;ll get the buttons in the back,&quot; Mom says. &quot;It takes a little practice to get them right. Remember, if you have a dress like this with very short sleeves, you should always wear a sweater so you don&#39;t show off your bare shoulders. Oh, and I&#39;ll ask your father if we can pick up a tall mirror for you — you&#39;ll need one to get these buttons on your own. And a vanity, too.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;What&#39;s a vanity?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;A little table for doing makeup.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Do I have to wear makeup?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Yes, you do,&quot; she says, finishing the last button and picking up a sizeable case full of tubes and powders. She starts applying creams and powders to your face, dabbing here and patting there with a fragrant little pouf. &quot;People will notice if you&#39;re not wearing anything. You don&#39;t want anyone to recognize you, do you? I didn&#39;t think so. Now hold still while I do this.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;At last, your face is made up to your mother&#39;s satisfaction. In the mirror, it looks like nothing much at all, considering how much effort went into it. Your skin looks smooth, your lips look pink, and your eyebrows a little darker. Maybe your lashes are thicker from the mascara. You reach up to touch your pink cheeks.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Don&#39;t touch,&quot; Mom admonishes you, smacking your hand. &quot;You&#39;ll get smudges. Now, I&#39;ve got a wig for you, and we&#39;re going to secure it on with bobby pins so it doesn&#39;t fall off. If you&#39;re going to stay like this, your hair will grow out, and we won&#39;t need it any more, but until then you&#39;ll have to be careful, okay?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;When she&#39;s all done with you, there&#39;s a certain Alice-in-Wonderland quality to the girl you see in the mirror: pink, pretty, and puzzled.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You go through your closet, looking for something else to wear that is equal to the concealment you managed to pull off yesterday. &lt;&lt;if $startsex == &quot;male&quot;&gt;&gt;A blazer, some slacks, a nice shirt. A tie.&lt;&lt;if $path.includes(&quot;sock stuffing&quot;)&gt;&gt; Another pair of socks for the front of your shorts.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; You feel like a bit of an imposter.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;A heavy woolen skirt, a blouse, a sweater. The dreaded girdle.&lt;&lt;if $path.includes(&quot;bra stuffing&quot;)&gt;&gt; More toilet tissue for the empty bra.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; You feel like a bit of an imposter.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Maybe nobody will recognize &lt;&lt;if $path.includes(&quot;shameful TG&quot;)&gt;&gt;you at school.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;at school again today.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; Maybe. But that would take luck, and you haven&#39;t had much of that in the last twenty-four hours.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Mom comes in to check on you, and gives a faint nod of approval. It looks like this is as good as you&#39;re going to get.&lt;/div&gt;

Mom is cooking dinner, $sib has arrived from school and clattered up the stairs, and the sound of traffic in the neighborhood has increased. $fr should already be home from the first day of school. Now you just have to find a moment to tell $acc[$fgen] what&#39;s going on with you.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Fortunately, $fr calls the house just before four o&#39;clock, saying $nom[$fgen] has your homework from school.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Your mother, who is listening with half an ear while she prepares a pot roast, says, &quot;Come over? Honey, you&#39;re sick.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I&#39;m feeling a little better,&quot; you say. &quot;It&#39;s aces, mom.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;She gives you a skeptical look. &quot;All right. Now go get dressed. You can&#39;t have friends over in your &lt;&lt;if $startsex == &quot;male&quot;&gt;&gt;pajamas.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;nightgown.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; And if your little friend gets sick, I&#39;m calling $poss[$fgen] parents and telling them why.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Half an hour later, $fr pedals over on $poss[$fgen] bike to hand-deliver your homework instructions.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;There&#39;s no homework on the first day of school, not unless you count reading Act One of that Shakespeare play. That should leave you plenty of time to meet up with $fr and explain what&#39;s going on. You&#39;ll have to walk, because Mom never picks you up from school. In the afternoons she&#39;s usually too busy cooking. You walk home as quickly as you dare.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;if $path.includes(&quot;reveal TG&quot;)&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;When you arrive home, Mom gives you a worried hug. &quot;How did everything go today, $name?&quot; she asks. &quot;Did anything ... change back to the way it was?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;No, Mom, it didn&#39;t,&quot; you admit, turning pink. &quot;It&#39;s still ... the same.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;All right,&quot; she says, withdrawing and wiping her hands unconsciously on her apron. &quot;I&#39;ve already called the school and arranged to talk to the principal later tonight. When your father gets home, we&#39;re going to call him up and explain the whole thing. I hate to interrupt Mr Fordyce with a telephone call between six and seven, but it can&#39;t be helped. After dinner, we&#39;ll try to sort out what else we can do. Oh, and you have an appointment with Dr Bennett on Monday.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Thanks, Mom,&quot; you say. &quot;By the way, is it okay if $fr comes over tonight? I ... I told $acc[$fgen] about what happened, but I said I&#39;d explain everything later after school.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;That&#39;s fine, dear,&quot; she says. &quot;And if $fr needs to use the telephone to tell $poss[$fgen] parents where $nom[$fgen] is, that&#39;s fine. As long as it&#39;s not long distance.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;$nomcap[$fgen] goes to my school, Mom,&quot; you remind her.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;When you arrive home, Mom gives you a happy hug. &quot;How was your first day, $name?&quot; she asks. &quot;Do you like all your classes?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Sure, they&#39;re fine,&quot; you say. &quot;It&#39;s, you know. It&#39;s school.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;You&#39;re usually more excited about school than that,&quot; she says, withdrawing and giving you a look of mild concern. &quot;Well, you&#39;ll probably like them better as the year goes on. You usually do. Don&#39;t forget, dinner will be at six, so be sure &lt;&lt;if $startsex == &quot;female&quot;&gt;&gt;you and $sibnick set the table by then.&quot;&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;you&#39;re ready to eat on time.&quot;&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Thanks, Mom, I will.&quot; you say. &quot;Oh, is it okay if $fr comes over tonight? We haven&#39;t seen each other all summer, and we just wanted to catch up a bit.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;That&#39;s fine, dear,&quot; she says. &quot;And if $fr needs to use the telephone to tell $poss[$fgen] parents where $nom[$fgen] is, that&#39;s fine. As long as it&#39;s not long distance.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I&#39;m right here, ma,&quot; you say. &quot;Why can&#39;t $sibnick do it? I&#39;ve got to get ready for the first day of school tomorrow.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&lt;&lt;if $sex == &quot;male&quot;&gt;&gt;&quot;Because $sibnick is still outside playing. I&#39;ll call her in while you set the table,&quot;&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;&quot;I don&#39;t care which one of you girls does it, and $sibnick is outside playing,&quot;&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; Mom says, wiping her hands on her apron. &quot;There&#39;s plenty of time to get ready for tomorrow after you have dinner.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Grumbling, you haul four dishes out of the kitchen cabinets and set everything out: plates, forks, knives, spoons, glasses, napkins.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&lt;&lt;if $sex == &quot;male&quot;&gt;&gt;&quot;Did you wash your hands?&quot; Mom asks. She licks her fingertips and tries to smooth down your cowlick. &quot;Go comb your hair. And when $sibnick comes in, make her run a brush through those tangles, too.&quot;&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;&quot;Don&#39;t forget to wash your hands and fix your hair,&quot; Mom reminds you. &quot;And when $sibnick gets in, make her scrub her face. I&#39;m sure she&#39;s got dirt everywhere. Make her run a brush through those tangles, too.&quot;&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;By the time Pop gets to the table, his tie is loosened, his shoes are off, and he&#39;s got the newspaper tucked under one arm and a highball glass with a whiskey and soda in the other hand that Mom made for him. &quot;You&#39;re looking very pretty tonight, girls,&quot; he says to &lt;&lt;if $sex == &quot;male&quot;&gt;&gt;Mom and $sib,&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;the three of you,&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; folding the newspaper under the corner of his plate. &quot;That&#39;s good, at least.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Mother gives you and $sibnick a warning look that says //don&#39;t ask your father about the news.// It&#39;s well known that Pop didn&#39;t care for anything he read in the paper lately. If it isn&#39;t the Russians creeping around, or the French government collapsing again, it&#39;s the specter of Communists like Alger Hiss looming behind every headline. He doesn&#39;t even have the Seattle Pilots to fall back on, &lt;&lt;if $sex == &quot;male&quot;&gt;&gt;because this summer they weren&#39;t much better than //bad//, and the St Louis Browns (his second love) were even worse.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;at least according to his endless grumbling over the sports section this summer.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Today, $sibnick must have missed Mom&#39;s Look, because she asks, &quot;Why, is something bad?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Nothing, sugar,&quot; Pop says to her, but he looks across the table at Mom, taps the newspaper, and mouths the word //polio.//&lt;/div&gt;
--&lt;&lt;link &quot;ask about polio&quot; &quot;1948 Family Talk&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;set $page to 0&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;/link&gt;&gt;

&lt;&lt;if $day == 2&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;if $path.includes(&quot;reveal TG&quot;)&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;There&#39;s already pot roast on the table when Pop gets home, and Mom rushes everyone through dinner as quickly as possible.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;No, $sibnick,&quot; she says wearily to your younger sister. &quot;Don&#39;t play with the carrots. You //like// carrots. We have an important phone call to make, and if you can&#39;t finish your supper like a good girl, you&#39;ll have to take it and finish it upstairs in your room. Cold.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Whining, instinctively realizing she&#39;s being excluded from this momentous phone call — she couldn&#39;t possibly know what it is — $sib says, &quot;C&#39;mon, Mom, can&#39;t I—&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;No, not tonight. Go on, scoot.&quot; Your mother watches $sibnick drag her feet out of the dining room, carrying the remains of her pot roast, until you finally hear her step on the stair treads and the sound of her bedroom door closing.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;All right, Earl, let&#39;s come to a decision,&quot; Mom says briskly, pushing her plate toward the center and folding her hands on the table. &quot;What are we going to do about $name?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;You&#39;ve called Dr Bennett?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Yes. $name is going in first thing on Monday.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;elseif $path.includes(&quot;Dot tattled&quot;)&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;The pot roast is a little late getting to the table, given the dramatics this afternoon, but Mom gamely rushes everyone through the meal as quickly as possible.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;All right, $sibnick,&quot; she says to your younger sister. &quot;You&#39;re going to have to take it and finish it upstairs in your room. Your father and $name and I have some things we have to talk about, and you&#39;re in enough trouble already.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Whining, instinctively realizing she&#39;s being excluded from this momentous conversation, $sib says, &quot;C&#39;mon, Mom, can&#39;t I—&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;No, you can&#39;t. You&#39;re skating on thin ice as it is.&quot; Your mother watches $sibnick drag her feet out of the dining room, carrying the remains of her pot roast, until you finally hear her step on the stair treads and the sound of her bedroom door closing.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Something happened to day, Earl,&quot; Mom says slowly, pushing the remains of her pot roast around her plate with a fork. &quot;$name seems to have come down with something.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Polio?&quot; is Pop&#39;s immediate answer, making him look up from the newspaper.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;No. Not polio.&quot; Mom clears her throat delicately. &quot;It seems that, overnight, $name has turned into a $girlboy[$gen].&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Pop stares at her, a forgotten piece of stewed carrot on his fork. &quot;You&#39;re kidding.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I&#39;m not, Earl, I&#39;m sorry,&quot; Mom says. &quot;$sibnick found out about it earlier today when she barged into $name&#39;s room. I&#39;ve already spoken to her about it. As soon as I found out, I called Dr Bennett to make an appointment. First thing Monday morning. And I&#39;ve made arrangements to call Mr Fordyce, the principal, before seven tonight.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;During dinner?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;It can&#39;t be helped. I haven&#39;t told him anything yet, but we&#39;ve got to let him know what our decision is.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;\
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Pop grunts, drumming his fingers on the newspaper underneath his right hand. &quot;We don&#39;t know what this condition thing is?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Dr Bennett thought he recognized it from some medical journal or other,&quot; Mom says. &quot;He says it&#39;s probably not contagious, so we don&#39;t need to worry about catching it.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Good to know,&quot; Pop says, his eyes widening a little. &quot;I hadn&#39;t thought of that. Well, what&#39;s left to decide, then?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;We have to decide what to do about school, if this doesn&#39;t wear off and $name is a $girlboy[$gen] for the rest of the year. What about clothing? What about scouts?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I don&#39;t think we should spend a lot of money on clothes.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I&#39;ve made a few calls to some of the other mothers in the PTA,&quot; Mom says. &quot;Families with &lt;&lt;print $girlboy[$gen] &amp; &quot;s&quot;&gt;&gt;, maybe a year or two older than $name. There&#39;s enough hand-me-downs out there, we&#39;ll be able to pick up some clothes tonight if we really need to.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You feel yourself turn a little pale at the idea of showing up to school tomorrow earing $girlboy[$oppgen] clothes.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Look at $acc[$oppgen],&quot; Pop says, glancing at you. &quot;$nomcap[$oppgen] looks like $nom[$oppgen]&#39;s going to be sick. Before you get to far ahead of yourself, maybe you should ask $name what //$nom[$oppgen]// wants.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;You //are// a good girl,&quot; $so says. &quot;You&#39;re real swell. It&#39;s just awful tough for a guy, you know, when one minute you&#39;re kissing a gal, and the next minute you&#39;re real hard up.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I&#39;m sure it is,&quot; you say, a little indifferently. You&#39;d heard the term //blue balls// before but you&#39;d never admit in polite company that you knew what it meant. Maybe to your girlfriend $gf. Maybe.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Aw gee, $name, you don&#39;t know what it&#39;s like,&quot; $so says, squirming on the bed and trying to adjust his trousers.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Anyway,&quot; you go on, &quot;my kid sister $sibnick is a real pill. If she ever found out we were going steady, she&#39;d tattle on me in two shakes of lamb&#39;s tail. She loves getting me in dutch with the folks.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Can&#39;t we just make out a little while longer?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;You should know better by now,&quot; you say. &quot;Besides, it&#39;s almost five-thirty, and my pop is going to be home any minute. You better shake a leg.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I&#39;m glad you think so,&quot; $so says with a smile, &quot;but we probably shouldn&#39;t spill the beans to your folks just yet. I bet they&#39;re going to flip their lids when they found out you&#39;re courting a young lady.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;He brushes you off with some talk about an outbreak in South Dakota or North Carolina or someplace &quot;back East,&quot; as he calls anything on the other side of the Rocky Mountains.

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Pop sighs and says, &quot;Just an article I saw in the paper. A woman flew up from California to be with her son before ... before the end. But polio got the little boy first.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Oh, dear,&quot; says Mom, clutching her throat.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Yes, I know,&quot; Pop says, sighing again. &quot;When are they finally going to lick this thing, that&#39;s what I want to know. They&#39;ve been working on that vaccine for, what? Ten years now? Eleven?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Seventeen,&quot; says Mom, glancing at you. &quot;I remember, because it was right before we got married and had $name. They had this doctor come to our school when I was a senior. Part of a vaccination trial. It didn&#39;t work, of course. A couple of the volunteers got polio anyway. And some of them had //kids// who got it. But they&#39;re working very hard, I&#39;m sure.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Pop rolls his eyes. &quot;Oh, yes, I&#39;m sure. Taking their sweet time, that&#39;s what I call it. I&#39;m telling you, we never would have taken this long in the Army. We&#39;d have gone in and got the job //done.// No nonsense, no sir.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Yes, dear.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Speaking of getting the job done,&quot; Pop says, putting down his fork.

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;You&#39;ll get the chance, don&#39;t worry, $name,&quot; Pop says. &quot;You&#39;re taking Wood Shop this year, too, don&#39;t forget.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;But you can help your father on Sunday,&quot; Mom urges you. &quot;Besides, you already got your Handywoman badge, back when you were an intermediate scout. You&#39;ll be able to put your skills to good use!&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;All right, Mother, I&#39;ll help out on Sunday,&quot; you promise her. Mom //would// know all about your Girl Scouts badges.

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Okay, Sunday, then,&quot; your father says.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Whatever you need, Daddy,&quot; you say. Giving up one of your weekend days isn&#39;t bad. At least if you&#39;re helping Pop on Sunday, you&#39;ll have some of Saturday free to go to the movies with $gf.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;&lt;if $page == 6&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Mom!&quot; you shout out into the hallway. &quot;Can you come here?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Mother comes into the upstairs hallway with an armload of sheets for the laundry. &lt;&lt;if $startsex == &quot;male&quot;&gt;&gt;&quot;Please don&#39;t shout at me across the house,&quot;&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;&quot;It&#39;s not ladylike to shout across the house, dear,&quot;&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; she says. &quot;What is it? Is the hot water not working again?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;No, it&#39;s — it&#39;s something weird,&quot; you say, and you &lt;&lt;if $startsex == &quot;male&quot;&gt;&gt;pull down your pajamas a little&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;lift up your nightgown a little&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; to show her what you mean.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Well, that&#39;s—&quot; she begins, and stops. &quot;My goodness! What happened? Did — did Dr Bennett make a mistake when you were—? But no, I used to change you when you were little, and — Earl!&quot; She stops rambling and calls for Pop. &quot;Earl, come here!&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Not Pop, please,&quot; you beg her. Even your voice sounds a little different. Not much, but a little &lt;&lt;if $startsex == &quot;male&quot;&gt;&gt;higher&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;deeper&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; than yesterday.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Very well, cover yourself up,&quot; Mom says, fretting. &quot;But I think you need to see a doctor right away.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;When Pop arrives, Mom has to tell him the whole thing, including her muddled half of the conversation, in excruciating detail while you stand in the bathroom turning redder and redder. At last, Pop says, &quot;Why didn&#39;t you say anything sooner?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;It just happened, Pop,&quot; you say. &quot;This morning. Or maybe last night. I had a really weird dream, and I woke up like this. I — I&#39;m not exactly sure //when// it happened.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;What did you dream about?&quot; Mom asks.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I don&#39;t remember,&quot; you say uncomfortably. &quot;It was just a dream, honestly.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;She stares at you for a moment, clucking her tongue. &quot;I guess there&#39;s nothing we can do about it right now,&quot; she says. &quot;You&#39;ll just have to go to school like that. I&#39;ll call Dr Bennett and make an appointment for you as soon as possible.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;display &quot;CleanReturn&quot;&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;\
&lt;&lt;if $page == 7&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You&#39;re not sure what in the world just happened to you, but you&#39;re not about to go //telling// anybody about it. You&#39;re not even sure you can face your friends at school like this. What if somebody found out?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;When you&#39;ve had a moment to use the toilet — an all-new experience you&#39;re not likely to forget in a hurry — you scuttle back to your bedroom, hop in bed, and pull the blankets up to your nose. Eventually Mom passes your bedroom door with an armful of laundry and knocks one-handed. &quot;$name, time to get up for school.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I don&#39;t feel well this morning,&quot; you moan, trying to sound extra pathetic. Your voice seems a little different — not much, just a little &lt;&lt;if $startsex == &quot;male&quot;&gt;&gt;higher&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;deeper&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; than yesterday. &quot;I don&#39;t think I can go.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Oh, dear,&quot; Mom says. You hardly //ever// stay home sick from school, good scout-in-training that you are. &quot;I&#39;ll take your temperature and call the doctor.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;It&#39;s my stomach,&quot; you say, hoping to put off the dreaded Clifton glass thermometer your mom bought at Rexall Drug all those years ago. It took //eons// to read properly.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;We&#39;ll see,&quot; was her answer.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Of course, there was no fever, but she insisted on calling Dr Bennett anyway. The doctor must not have said anything conclusive, because Mom let you stay in bed. &quot;You&#39;d better go downstairs and telephone one of your friends and ask them to bring your homework over for you. I&#39;ll make chicken soup for lunch,&quot; she offers. &quot;That should settle your stomach. If that doesn&#39;t help, I&#39;ll bring up some castor oil.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Chicken soup, castor oil and the Clifton thermometer: Mom&#39;s solution for everything. But at least she&#39;s likely to leave you alone up in your room, mostly, while you sort out what to do about all ... all this.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;display &quot;CleanReturn&quot;&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;\
&lt;&lt;if $page == 8&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You&#39;re barely out the door before Mom is climbing the stairs, her footfalls thumping on each step with the tread of approaching doom.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;All right, $name, what&#39;s all this?&quot; Mom asks sternly, with $sibnick hiding behind Mom&#39;s skirts with a look of devilish glee. &quot;$sib just came downstairs with some wild story, and I want to know what you&#39;ve been telling her.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;She&#39;s just trying to get me grounded, that&#39;s all,&quot; you protest. It&#39;s a little white lie, perhaps, but it&#39;s got some truth to it.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Is this true, $sib?&quot; she demands. &quot;Are you telling stories?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;No, mama, I //saw// it,&quot; she says plaintively.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;And why were you able to see it?&quot; Mom asks in a shrewd voice. &quot;Why was $sibnick able to see anything at all? Were you showing it to $fr upstairs in your room? Were you thinking about playing Doctor with your little friend?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Mom, I wasn&#39;t playing Doctor!&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Then you&#39;d better have a good explanation why you had your underpants down when your sister came into the room,&quot; Mom says. &quot;Why don&#39;t you tell me what that explanation is, hmm?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
--[[explain it to her|1948 Family Talk][$path.push(&quot;Dot tattled&quot;), $page to 9]]
&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;\
&lt;&lt;if $page == 9&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You don&#39;t have much of a choice. It&#39;s either admit to your mother that something strange happened last night, and you were asking $fr what to do, or allow $sib&#39;s falsehood to remain standing and permit Mom to think you were playing Doctor with another $girlboy[$fgen].

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;So you explain the whole thing, and you let Mom see what happened to you overnight.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Hmmm,&quot; she says, her mouth a thin line. &quot;That&#39;s unusual. All right, I suppose I can understand why you were showing it to your friend, but honey, why didn&#39;t you tell //us?// &lt;&lt;if $path.includes(&quot;shameful TG&quot;)&gt;&gt;If you had to stay home from school because of this, then I wish you would have told me the reason why.

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Do we have to tell everybody?&quot; you ask.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Yes. We&#39;ll discuss it tonight over dinner,&quot; Mom says with finality. &quot;When your father gets home. I&#39;m sure that&#39;s what he&#39;s going to decide.&lt;/div&gt;

Maybe they could help us.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;That&#39;s a good idea,&quot; Pop says. &quot;What kind of help did you have in mind?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Well, you know,&quot; you say, guessing aloud. &quot;If we tell them what happened, maybe I don&#39;t have to do gym class with the rest of the $girlboy[$oppgen]s. I could do something else instead. Or maybe they&#39;d led me go to the school as a $girlboy[$gen] until it ... it, you know, I stop being one. I mean, it&#39;s not //my// fault this happened, right? They can&#39;t get too mad at me.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Let a $girlboy[$oppgen] into the school wearing $girlboy[$gen] clothes?&quot; Pop asks suspiciously. &quot;Gym classes and everything?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;We&#39;d write the school a note about gym class,&quot; Mom says. &quot;If they would accept that.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;And if they don&#39;t?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Maybe we ask the school to enroll $name under some other name, like &lt;&lt;if $startsex == &quot;male&quot;&gt;&gt;$fchoice.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;$mchoice.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; We could say $nom[$gen]&#39;s a cousin that&#39;s staying with us, and maybe the school would play along.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;

Oh, the teasing you&#39;d get! &quot;I don&#39;t think they&#39;d be very good at keeping all this a secret. They&#39;d have to tell all my teachers, and the school nurse, and somebody could find out, and then I&#39;d have to run off and join a freakshow or something.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;That&#39;s a good point,&quot; Pop says. &quot;People can be cruel. So what did you have in mind instead?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; you say, trying to pin down your thoughts. &quot;Maybe we just don&#39;t tell them anything? Write me a note to get out of gym class, and maybe that&#39;s enough. By Monday I could be completely back to normal, don&#39;t you think?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Mom gives you a melancholy smile. &quot;We can always hope so.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;

Then you&#39;ll just do the work for both sets of classes.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;And you&#39;ll pick up clothes tonight?&quot; Pop asks.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I made some calls,&quot; Mom promises. &quot;Some of the PTA mothers have some hand-me-downs we can have. If you take your car and I take mine, we&#39;ll cover a lot more ground. Do you mind?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;No, no,&quot; Pop says, pushing himself away from the table. &quot;Let&#39;s get going. $name, you should start getting ready for bed.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;elseif $sched == &quot;pussyboy schedule&quot; or $sched == &quot;dickgirl schedule&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;All right,&quot; Mom says, hanging up the phone with a clatter. &quot;It took a little convincing, but Mr Fordyce has agreed to let you attend school under your own name. I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s a good idea, myself, because I&#39;m //sure// those bullies at school are going to tease you when they find out about your ... your condition.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;What about clothes?&quot; Pop asks.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Oh, that&#39;s right,&quot; Mom says. &quot;I almost forgot. Mr Fordyce says you have to stick to the school dress code for $girlboy[$gen]s. If you switch back, then you stick to the dress code for $girboy[$oppgen]s again. I&#39;ll write you a note to get you out of the regular gym class and into something else.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I can&#39;t just skip gym?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;No, it&#39;s required for all students, unless there&#39;s some reason they can&#39;t,&quot; Mom says.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;And you can,&quot; Pop says firmly. &quot;Look at you, you have two legs, two arms. There&#39;s got to be something you can do. I know guys who came back from the war who&#39;d //love// to have their arms and legs. You&#39;re not skipping gym, no sir.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;And I agree with your father,&quot; Mom says. &quot;All right, Earl, if you and I each take our cars, we&#39;ll be able to drive around and pick up some clothes. I made a few calls. Some of the mothers in the PTA have hand-me-downs we can have. $name, you&#39;d better start getting ready for bed.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;elseif $sched == &quot;secret girl schedule&quot; or $sched == &quot;secret boy schedule&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;All right, I think we&#39;re all settled,&quot; Mom says, hanging up the phone with a clatter. &quot;I didn&#39;t tell Mr Fordyce about your ... your condition. I just said you have to be excused from regular gym class for the rest of the year. They&#39;ll put you in an independent study program so you still get your exercise, but not with the other kids in your class.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Thanks, Mom.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;With a little bit of luck,&quot; Mom goes on, &quot;on Monday when we see Dr Bennett, he&#39;ll have a nice little remedy for you, and this will be all over soon.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I sure hope so.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Me too, honey. All right, it&#39;s been a long day. You&#39;d better start getting ready for bed.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;All right,&quot; you say, standing and picking up your plate.&lt;/div&gt;

The attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941 interrupted a decades-long progressive education movement emphasizing science, engineering, and math, and which focused on critical analysis of American institutions. After Pearl Harbor, when fear and paranoia set in, such progressive notions were scrapped in favor of the &quot;lifestyle adjustment curriculum.&quot;

This was designed to teach life skills to the 60% of students who would not go on to post-secondary education. About 30% of students would graduate, and there were plenty of jobs available for this level of education. It proposed to teach American students to be good, patriotic (and pliable) citizens, claiming that the old progressive education taught children to be materialistic and gave them bankrupt morals. The &quot;lifestyle&quot; curriculum was criticized (at the time, and also later) for being too soft and non-academic, emphasizing daily life skills (like literacy) over rigorous study (like understanding and questioning what you read).

Part of the reason for this focus was a renewed interest in integrating American education with national defense priorities. While recruiting soldiers for World War II, the Army had to reject hundreds of thousands of applicants for being illiterate. They also discovered how disorganized and non-standardized the curriculum could be across various states; the quality of education varied widely. There was also a shortage of people skilled in modern foreign languages.

Homework was fairly unknown, especially at lower age levels; most high school students had less than 2 hours per evening. When the Soviets launched Sputnik in 1957 it forced a massive re-think of education in America vis-a-vis national defense priorities, and the burden of nightly homework began to ramp skyward.

Courses: reading, grammar, written and mental arithmetic, social studies, science, family life, hygiene, health, religion, speech. Geography (maps), languages, gym, home economics, biology, shop (&quot;industrial arts&quot;). Photography.

There would also be an emphasis on geography (especially map familiarity). Biology and home ec courses would start to teach first aid and nursing. During the war, schools would hold drives for paper and scrap metal. Intra-varsity athletics were emphasized, along with calisthenics drills, to increase student health in the event of national need. Social Studies courses focused on problems that related directly to national welfare -- unlike before the war, when the courses focused on critical problems within the US. (Our player in 1948 would have seen both of these techniques.)

Note: up until 1970 or so, it was common for boys to swim naked in gym class; suits &quot;of the simplest type&quot; were mandatory for girls. This is a fascinating sidelight into education in the 1940s, so I&#39;ll use it.

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Oh, gee,&quot; says Tommy, stricken. &quot;Not //swimming.//&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;What&#39;s the matter with swimming?&quot; the other boy asks. &quot;You go swimming all the time down at the lake.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Yes, but not //naked,//&quot; Tommy objects.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;The other boy laughs. &quot;Sure you do. I&#39;ve seen you go skinny-dipping before.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Besides, you know those swimsuits aren&#39;t hygenic,&quot; another boy points out. &quot;You wear clothes, you&#39;ll get the pool all dirty. Everybody knows that.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;What&#39;s old Mrs Bell going to make us do?&quot; asks one girl, a tenth-grader named Polly.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Four weeks of swimming,&quot; says another girl.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Oh no!&quot; Polly says, turning ashen.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;What&#39;s wrong with swimming?&quot; asks the other girl. &quot;You go swimming at the lake all the time.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;It&#39;s those horrible old school swimsuits,&quot; Polly explains with a shudder. &quot;You can see right through them.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;\
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;//Ugh. Swimming.// You hope against hope that you don&#39;t have to, but it turns out your worst nightmare has come true. $thisgym is going to make everybody swim.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Fortunately, that day will not be today. &quot;There&#39;s no need to dress for class today. Before we do any exercises, we&#39;ve got to get everybody measured and weighed in,&quot; $thisgym announces. &quot;It&#39;s important to have a way to measure physical fitness, so we can see if you are improving your bodies and your health.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Throughout the class, &lt;&lt;if $startsex == &quot;male&quot;&gt;&gt;$thisgym talks endlessly about the need for good, solid young bodies who are ready to fight for their country at a moment&#39;s notice. He doesn&#39;t let up for a minute, often booming in some poor boy&#39;s ear as he addresses the rest of the class.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;$thisgym goes on and on about how young ladies these days have to stay in shape if they expect to catch a husband. It&#39;s an endless refrain. She often calls out specific girls who are a little under- or overweight, making loud suggestions on calisthenics and stretches the girl should start doing, and different foods she should be eating.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Luckily, measuring everybody up takes most of the whole class. &lt;&lt;if $startsex == &quot;male&quot;&gt;&gt;The gym instructor gives you a strange look when he notes your height, but he doesn&#39;t take any other awkward measurements of your strangely altered body, so that&#39;s good.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;The gym instructor nods approvingly when she takes down your height, commenting you appear to have grown another inch over the summer. She does give you a strange look when taking measurements of your waist, shoulders, and hips, but instead of barking at you, she just purses her lips and says, &quot;Well, you&#39;ll develop soon enough.&quot;&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Still, you&#39;re going to have to do something about this whole swimming thing. Is there any way you can get out of it?&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;We have new textbooks this year,&quot; $hist announces. &quot;We want to make sure all of our students have a firm grounding in American history, and that we all understand what a unique and special country this is.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;It strikes you as a little strange. You remember your teachers in previous history classes weren&#39;t afraid to criticize social issues in America. This textbook seems filled with nothing but abject praise for everything about America, and no mention of any issues or problems that might need improvement.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;$hist&#39;s reasoning soon becomes clear. &quot;The government wants to make certain that we all know what it takes to be good citizens, in light of the Communist threat which stretches around the world,&quot; he says. &quot;That means Congress is taking a much greater interest in any possible Communist threats to our way of life, including how we teach subjects like this one. We can&#39;t be too careful. Now, this might be a little different from history classes you have taken in the past--&quot; he coughs nervously-- &quot;but if any of you has any questions, feel free to see me after class.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;

You&#39;re bundled into a stuffy, warm classroom with a crowd of other girls — it&#39;s hard not to think of them as //other// girls, in spite of what has happened to you — to listen to $steno, a boring old woman with a droning voice that makes you want to fall asleep. She spends most of the first class babbling on about how useful stenography is.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Many of you girls will go on to become secretaries,&quot; she says. &quot;Or you might work for someone important, like a doctor or a lawyer, where note-taking is very useful. Even if you don&#39;t go on to a career of your own, you will find stenography is very valuable for taking notes over a telephone, because shorthand enables you to write very quickly so you don&#39;t miss anything.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;//Maybe I won&#39;t become a secretary,// you think to yourself, trying to ignore the cock you&#39;re carrying under several concealing layers of fabric. //Not with one of __these.__ I could be the doctor or the lawyer, I bet.//&lt;/div&gt;

She usually has this bright, frazzled look about her, as if she has too many students and not enough brain power to keep track of it all.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;This year, she seems a little calmer. &quot;I&#39;m so glad to see so many of your lovely faces again this year,&quot; she says warmly. &quot;If any of you has a younger brother or sister, you might have heard that the school district has finally hired another music teacher for elementary and junior high, which will leave me more time for all of my high school students.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You remember the teacher shortages of 1946. After the war, there just weren&#39;t enough teachers to go around.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;The first thing we&#39;re going to do is sing the national anthem, and then the school song,&quot; she says. &quot;I&#39;ll go around the room as you&#39;re singing and listen to your voices, because I think some of them might still be changing. Then I can separate you into your proper registers.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Fortunately, it doesn&#39;t sound like your voice has changed much this year. &lt;&lt;if $startsex == &quot;female&quot;&gt;&gt;It might be a //little// deeper, but lots of girls&#39; voices dropped at least a tiny bit.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;It might be a //little// higher, but not so much that $music is likely to notice.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; None of the other students around you mention anything, anyway.&lt;/div&gt;

They&#39;ve met all their old friends at the cafeteria, just like you and $fr did, and they&#39;re not quite ready to go back to learning.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;$span gets everybody started with some basic introductions in Spanish, and you and your classmates are chatting again.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;¡Hola!&quot; you say to the $girlboy[$gen] next to you. &quot;Me llamo $name.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Mucho gusto,&quot; $nom[$gen] says. &quot;Me llamo &lt;&lt;if $startsex == &quot;male&quot;&gt;&gt;Eddie.&quot;&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;Nancy.&quot;&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;$span is nearby and happens to hear. &quot;No, no,&quot; she murmurs, moving closer. &quot;That&#39;s the wrong form. Remember, if you&#39;re a $girlboy[$oppgen], you say &lt;&lt;if $startsex == &quot;male&quot;&gt;&gt;//encantado//, with an O. It means you&#39;re male.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;//encantada//, with an A. It means you&#39;re female.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; Now try again.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Blushing bright pink, you correct yourself. How could you have gotten that mixed up, today of all days? You&#39;re //definitely// a &lt;&lt;if $startsex == &quot;male&quot;&gt;&gt;boy.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;girl.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; Definitely.&lt;/div&gt;

Hopefully, there&#39;s no way you can embarrass yourself in //this// class.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Unfortunately, the instructor, $geom, is the same one you have for gym class. As if carrying on directly from his previous speech in the gymnasium, he goes on and on about how the Army needs good, brave men to step up and learn to become engineers and cartographers. &quot;Geometry is a useful skill,&quot; he tells the class. &quot;In this class, we will help you to read maps and triangulate distances, to find areas and make calculations for all kinds of construction, and we&#39;ll even do some experiments in the field. I have some lessons planned where you must follow directions on a map, and then calculate the distance to a hidden gun emplacement.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;The boys in the class — the lucky ones who haven&#39;t had any strange transformations in the middle of the night — raise a cheer at the prospect. You just feel a little sick. Somehow, even mathematics has been turned into a boys-only club, and you&#39;re not quite sure whether you belong to that club any more.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;In this class, you will learn the basics of business math skills. These are applicable skills for any kind of business, whether you are planning to take over your father&#39;s shoe store, or if you&#39;re going to start your own construction business. You young ladies may also use these math skills for running a household and making a budget for you and your husband,&quot; he adds, as an afterthought.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;//Oh really? Then my husband is going to be in for a surprise,// you think with a mixture of humor and dread.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Those of you who graduate high school and go on to college,&quot; $bkp continues, &quot;will be able to take courses in higher mathematics later on. This course will focus on the practical, every-day life skills that you&#39;ll need to be a prosperous businessman. Or even a savvy homemaker.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;He passes out textbooks after that, and you&#39;re left to wonder which one of those two things you&#39;re likely to be.&lt;/div&gt;

The instructor is $homeec, a youthful woman with a cheery smile, a Midwestern twang, and a frilly apron over her day dress. She assures the class that she has a science degree in Household Management from the University of Iowa.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;In order to run a successful home,&quot; $homeec says in a clear voice, &quot;the modern woman is going to have to know not only how to //use// all of her labor-saving machines, but how to conduct her own repairs. Imagine it, ladies: you&#39;re cooking dinner for your husband, and you&#39;re making a nice aspic. Let&#39;s say you&#39;re making jellied eggs. You&#39;re mixing up the gelatin. Suddenly, the Mixmaster breaks. How are you going to manage?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;The girls exchange concerned looks. &quot;Use a hand beater?&quot; one asks timidly.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Possibly, yes. That&#39;s one way to do it. But after this class,&quot; $homeec says, &quot;you&#39;ll be able to take apart your own Mixmaster and see what&#39;s wrong. You&#39;ll be able to repair that loose wire, or change out a frayed cord, or replace a bad fuse, all by yourself. Not only is it economical, and it will save your family money, but you&#39;ll never have to worry your husband about little household chores like this. That aspic will come out of the refrigerator on time!&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;A girl named Mandy raises her hand, with a worried look on her face. &quot;$homeec,&quot; she says, &quot;aren&#39;t these machines full of oil and grease and such?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Some of them, yes,&quot; $homeec says gravely, &quot;but with the right soaps and detergents, you&#39;ll be able to clean up any messes. We don&#39;t want you girls to worry about getting your hands dirty. Remember, most of your mothers worked in the factories during the war!&quot; She gives the class an encouraging smile. &quot;And just in case we ever need you young ladies to march off to the factory floors again, we need to make sure you&#39;re familiar with basic household tools.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Somehow, you think another fate might be in store for you, if anybody ever finds out what&#39;s happened underneath your skirt.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;This!&quot; he calls out gruffly, holding up his disfigured hand. &quot;This, boys, is the kind of thing that can happen to you, if you don&#39;t listen carefully to me and you don&#39;t use the proper safety equipment in this class. I will be signing you off on every piece of equipment in my shop before you are allowed to touch it. You see the yellow lines on the floor? Right there, around the band saw, and the lathe? Those are your safety lines. If you&#39;re not using that tool, you must stand behind that yellow line. Yes, you,&quot; he says, pointing to a boy with a raised hand.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;How did you lose your fingers?&quot; the boy asks.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;In the war,&quot; $shop says, looking down. &quot;It&#39;s a story for later. I&#39;ll tell you boys some other time.&quot; He seems uncomfortable, and moves on quickly. &quot;Believe me, you do not want to lose part of your hand! Imagine not being able to go fishing, or shoot a bow at summer camp. Imagine not being able to work at your father&#39;s store because you can&#39;t carry anything heavy.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;//I can imagine it,// you think to yourself.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;And that is why I expect each one of you to pay close attention. If I see you daydreaming or lollygagging, I will send you out of class for the day, and you will get a zero on attendance. No exceptions.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Are we going to work on any metals this year?&quot; asks one boy.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Raise your hand first, Johnny. No, we are not doing any metals this year. The Industrial Arts program has expanded to a second course, just for metalworking and machining, so if you would rather be in that course, talk to the school secretary and get your class changed. Yes, you.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;The first boy speaks, his eyes still fixed on $shop&#39;s mangled right hand. &quot;What if we don&#39;t want to take shop any more?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;It&#39;s mandatory,&quot; $shop says curtly. &quot;These are skills every boy should learn. You can&#39;t be much of a man unless you can fix things up around the house.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;//There&#39;s another qualification,// you think. //And right now, I don&#39;t meet it.//&lt;/div&gt;

	Here we have to choose which schedule the player will adhere to
	on any specific day. This means we calculate the following:
	
	1. Is the player presently male or female?
	2. Is the player known to be a Zeta?
		a. The school knows the player is a Zeta.
			i. Player must attend sex-appropriate classes.
			ii. Player may attend previous classes, with exemptions.
		b. The school doesn&#39;t know the player is a Zeta.
			i. Player is masquerading as starting sex.
			ii. Player is masquerading as a new student of opp sex.

	The logic goes like this:
	
	KNOWN TG: the school knows
		REVEAL TG: you&#39;re open about becoming opp sex
			RESULT: same schedule, with exceptions (skip gym, etc).
		NON-REVEAL TG: you&#39;re hiding when you&#39;re the opp sex
			RESULT: masquerade as opp sex; opp schedule, w exceptions.
	UNKNOWN TG: the school has no idea
		REVEAL TG: you&#39;re open about becoming opp sex
			RESULT: masquerade as opp sex; opp schedule, no exceptions.
		NON-REVEAL TG: you&#39;re hiding when you&#39;re the opp sex
			RESULT: same schedule, no exceptions (skip class or bring
			a note from home).

	boy schedule: player is boy or dickgirl; participates fully as a
		male in that class
	girl schedule: player is pussyboy or girl; participates fully as a
		female in that class
	
	pussyboy schedule: player is pussyboy; school excludes certain
		classes while the player is unable to participate
	dickgirl schedule: player is dickgirl; school excuses certain

It means you&#39;ll have to spend the next several hours close to the toilet, and that makes you reconsider the idea of playing sick. You can&#39;t keep this up forever or you&#39;ll have to sleep in the bathroom until you turn eighteen.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Apart from that, however, she leaves you to your own devices. At eight-thirty, she announces that she&#39;s leaving to drive $sibnick to school, which starts a little later than yours. &quot;And then I&#39;ll go to the grocery store,&quot; she calls up the stairs. &quot;If I&#39;m making chicken soup, we&#39;ll need a few things.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Thanks, Mom!&quot; you call back.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;If you&#39;re feeling up to it,&quot; she says, &quot;you might have a hot bath while I&#39;m out. I find that helps me sometimes.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Okay!&quot;&lt;/div&gt; You feel strange shouting, as if Mom is going to recognize some change in your voice.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;But she doesn&#39;t say anything about it. A few minutes later and you hear $sib thundering down the stairs, then back up to retrieve her forgotten satchel, then back down again. The front door closes with a click. You hear the sound of Mom&#39;s old Packard starting fitfully to life. It drives away.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;The house falls eerily silent.&lt;/div&gt;
--[[go check yourself in the hall mirror|1948 Skip First Day][$page to 1]]

&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;\
&lt;&lt;if $page == 1&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You haven&#39;t really had a proper chance to do this. A brief survey, if that, in the bathroom. Now that the house is yours and there&#39;s no danger of anyone walking in on you, you rush to the full-length mirror hanging at the top of the stairs. &lt;&lt;if $startsex == &quot;female&quot;&gt;&gt;You have a vanity mirror, but it&#39;s fairly small, and it&#39;s set at desk height.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;You have a small facial mirror for combing your hair, but it&#39;s small and doesn&#39;t show much.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; The mirror in the hall is better.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You peel off your &lt;&lt;if $startsex == &quot;female&quot;&gt;&gt;nightgown, your girdle, and all your layers of underwear,&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;pajama top and bottom, kick off your underwear, &lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; and get a good look at what you&#39;re dealing with.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;if $startsex == &quot;female&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You&#39;re a boy, all right. There&#39;s no doubt about it. Your whole body says so.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Your shoulders are about the same width, maybe a bit broader, and you have slightly more muscle. There&#39;s a few little tufts of hair on your chest, and your boobs are so flat — disappeared entirely, actually — that you can see the pectorals underneath. There&#39;s even a faint trail of hairs on your belly leading downward from your navel. And hairs on your shoulders. And hairs on your forearms. Hairs everywhere.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Your hands are a tiny bit bigger. Not much, but a little. Your chin seems a fraction more square, and your brow slightly more prominent. If you didn&#39;t know better, at first glance you&#39;d say this was the face of a teenage boy. But it&#39;s still you. You frown at your face closely, running your fingers on your chin. No signs of stubble, but maybe just a few wipsy hairs on your upper lip.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;And the penis, of course. It hangs there, getting in the way, a shaft and a hanging sack containing your testicles, sitting there like a new student in class you&#39;ve never met before. It&#39;s hard to stand in the usual way, feet close, thighs pressed together. You feel pinched up, like your balls need a little room to breathe. When your feet are spread apart, it&#39;s much more comfortable.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You&#39;re a girl, all right. There&#39;s no doubt about it. Your whole body says so.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Your shoulders are a fraction more narrow, and your arms seem to have lost some muscle. They look like pipestems. You weren&#39;t all that strong before, but now you look practically anemic. The wisps of chest hair that you had been carefully cultivating are gone, as is the hair on your lower belly. Even the hair on your arms is finer and fainter than before. And your nipples seem prouder. Puffier. Your chest, never in the league of a Charles Atlas to begin with, seems oddly squishy.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Your hands are a tiny bit smaller and more slender. Not so much that you&#39;d notice unless you knew what to look for. Your chin seems less prominent, your jaw more delicate. If you didn&#39;t know better, at first glance you&#39;d say this was the face of a teenage girl. But it&#39;s still you. You frown at your face closely, running your fingers on your chin. No signs of stubble. None at all. Not even those telltale little hairs on your upper lip.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;And your cock is missing, of course. It used to just //be// there, like an old friend, whenever you glanced at yourself. Now it&#39;s absent, like a student suddenly missing from class who leaves an empty desk behind. There&#39;s nothing there except a small breeze between your legs that makes you feel peculiarly vulnerable. If you stand with your feet close and your thighs pressed together, that feeling is a little less bothersome.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;\
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Okay, $name,&quot; you tell your naked reflection. &quot;Now what?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
--[[take a bath|1948 Skip First Day][$page to 3]]
&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;\
&lt;&lt;if $page == 2&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You&#39;ve been ravenously hungry ever since you woke up. It&#39;s time for some breakfast.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Checking to make sure the coast is clear, even though you&#39;re positive that Mom has already left, you creep down the stairs. There&#39;s no sign of anyone, so you relax and head for the kitchen.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;There&#39;s a little Malt-O-Meal left on the stovetop, although all the rest of the breakfast dishes have been scrubbed and tucked away in the drainage rack beside the sink. You manage to eat some — cold, unfortunately — and that helps a little. Now you don&#39;t feel quite so empty.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;The remains of Dad&#39;s morning newspaper are strewn about the kitchen table. All the sections have been separated, folded backward, and turned this way and that. This is usually how he leaves the newspaper in the morning. Mom has a look through the headlines and flips through the classified ads, then she tidies it away. Eventually the newspaper ends up in the firewood storage bin next to the kindling.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;As you glance over the newspaper, the word //polio// catches your eye.&lt;/div&gt;
--[[check newspaper about polio|1948 Skip First Day][$page to 4, $path.push(&quot;polio newspaper&quot;)]]
&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;\
&lt;&lt;if $page == 3&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Since your mother mentioned it, you decide a hot bath might help you throw off some of this worry. It might not change you back to normal, but it certainly couldn&#39;t hurt. There&#39;s even some soap flakes, so you can have a nice modest bubble bath, &lt;&lt;if $startsex == &quot;male&quot;&gt;&gt;although it&#39;s going to make you feel a bit like Ava Gardner in //One Touch of Venus//, that movie $so dragged you to last month.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;just like Ava Gardner in //One Touch of Venus//, that movie you dragged $so to last month.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;At first, it&#39;s quite relaxing. The hot water washes away your accumulated tension, and the mounds of bubbles conceal the shape of your body beneath the water so you don&#39;t have to think about it.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;But bubbles can only do so much, and eventually your hands brush up against the wrong bit of flesh, or your thighs slide together from all that slippery soap, and you notice all over again that your body isn&#39;t the same shape as it always was. Your very skin is no longer so familiar to you.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Should you try to acquaint yourself with your body? Explore with your hands? You have to clean yourself, after all.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;With your hands, you start exploring your new flesh. Gingerly. Guiltily. It goes against everything your &lt;&lt;if $startsex == &quot;female&quot;&gt;&gt;mother says, about how good Girl Scouts don&#39;t get merit badges playing panty polo.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;father says, that you&#39;ll never make Eagle Scout by getting merit badges in pocket pool.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; On the other hand, $thisgym is always going on about &quot;hygiene,&quot; which means cleanliness, and you&#39;ve never //been// in this shape before, so you&#39;re sure it&#39;s never been cleaned.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You &lt;&lt;if $startsex == &quot;female&quot;&gt;&gt;touch your new penis daintily, withdrawing quickly, but nothing happens. It doesn&#39;t do anything. It certainly shows no signs of becoming enormous and randy, like Mildred Sacks said penises do sometimes. There&#39;s just some extra flesh there. You can touch it and pull it, but it remains inert.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;prod yourself down there, going by feel, not sure what you&#39;ll find. There is some pliable flesh, like lips, with a warm opening in between if you poke around a little. Nothing unusual happens. Tentatively, you feel around and find a little knob of flesh. That must be the magic button, which is what Jimmy O&#39;Toole called that secret part of a woman that makes her go crazy for you. But this little nub doesn&#39;t seem to do anything.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Disappointed, you finish your bath. You were half-expecting some big, exciting sensations from your new equipment. Changing into a $girlboy[$gen] hardly seems worth the trouble so far.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;There&#39;s got to be //somebody// you can talk to about all of this.&lt;/div&gt;
--[[call doctor|1948 Skip First Day][$page to 5, $path.push(&quot;call doctor&quot;)]]
&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;\
&lt;&lt;if $page == 4&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;The headline reads MORE BAD NEWS FOR KIND POLIO VACCINE.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You turn the newspaper toward you and read the article. Apparently, a number of years ago a doctor named Horace Kind had run some experiments on a new polio vaccine. It hadn&#39;t worked out, of course, because Mom and Pop were still flipping out about the dangers of polio.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You check the rest of the headlines. There&#39;s another suspected outbreak, this one in Auburn, which is not too far from here. That must have been what they were hinting at last night.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;//Wait a minute, maybe that&#39;s what this is,// you think. //It&#39;s some new kind of ... $girlboy[$gen] disease, and I happened to catch it somehow.//&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;The headlines on the front page don&#39;t mention anything about any such disease. It just goes on about HUAC, an acronym that seems familiar. The House Unamerican Affairs Committee, according to the article. Communists being investigated everywhere. Alger Hiss. That&#39;s right, you remember now. No sign of any mysterious disease affecting teenagers in the Puget Sound area.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;If anybody would know anything about such a disease, your family doctor might.&lt;/div&gt;
--[[call doctor|1948 Skip First Day][$page to 5, $path.push(&quot;call doctor&quot;)]]
&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;\
&lt;&lt;if $page == 5&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Dr Bennett&#39;s number is written on a smudged piece of piece of paper and tacked to a small corkboard beside the kitchen telephone. You haven&#39;t had to call this number since $sibnick fell down the porch steps and broke her arm a few summers ago.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Doctor Bennett&#39;s office,&quot; says a chirpy receptionist.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Hi, my name is $name &lt;&lt;textbox &quot;$lastname&quot; $lastname&gt;&gt;. My mom takes me to your office sometimes. May I speak with Dr Bennett?&quot; you ask.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;She asks you to spell your name, and you can hear her busily thumbing through some files. &quot;Kendall,&quot; she says triumphantly. &quot;Hold, please, while I see if the doctor is in.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Moments later, a man&#39;s voice comes on the line. &quot;This is Bob Bennett.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Unable to contain yourself, you launch into an explanation of your strange morning, rushing through all the feelings of oddness in your new body, your concern that you have no idea how it happened, having to skip school, not knowing how to change back, and hoping your parents don&#39;t find out about it. Dr Bennett listens carefully on the other end, occasionally making noises of confirmation and asking questions.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Finally, he clears his throat. &quot;Well, I suppose I could make time to see you this afternoon. I remember reading about something like this before, but it&#39;s been a few months, and it didn&#39;t seem all that reliable at the time. Would three o&#39;clock do?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Uh, yes, I suppose,&quot; you say. &quot;I&#39;m home from school all day. I was just hoping—&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Hoping that Irene — your mother — doesn&#39;t find out, eh?&quot; he asks knowingly. &quot;Don&#39;t worry. I&#39;ll do a quick exam in your room, if that&#39;s all right with you.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;That sounds about as good an arrangement as you could expect, so you agree and hang up.&lt;/div&gt;
--[[go back to your bedroom|1948 Skip First Day][$page to 6]]
&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;\
&lt;&lt;if $page == 6&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You rush back to your bedroom just in time. Mom&#39;s car pulls up in the driveway just as you&#39;re crawling back into bed.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;For the next few hours, you hear pots and pans clanking in the kitchen as you sit alone in your bedroom, your mind racing. You&#39;re still a $girlboy[$gen] and it&#39;s been //hours.// Nothing has changed.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You try to sleep, but you can&#39;t quite drift off. Who knows what would happen if you let your eyes slip shut?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;It must be hours later when Mom knocks on the door. &quot;Would you like some soup?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
--[[eat lunch|1948 Skip First Day][$page to 7]]
&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;\
&lt;&lt;if $page == 7&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You&#39;re still ravenously hungry, so you eat three bowls of soup before it finally feels like you&#39;re getting filled up. Whatever happened to your body last night, it must have taken a lot of effort.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Mom comes to collect the bowl a little later, commenting happily on how your appetite seems to be coming back. Perhaps you overdid it a little on the soup.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;if $path.includes(&quot;call doctor&quot;)&gt;&gt;--[[wait for Dr Bennett|1948 Skip First Day][$page to 8]]&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;--[[try to take a nap|1948 Skip First Day][$page to 9]]&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;\
&lt;&lt;if $page == 8&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You while away the hours until your appointment by trying to nap, but it doesn&#39;t seem to work.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Eventually, you hear the sound of the telephone downstairs. After a few minutes of muffled speech, Mom climbs the stairs to your bedroom and informs you that Dr Bennett will be a little late. &quot;Did you ask the doctor to make a house call?&quot; she asks, worried.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;He offered,&quot; you say, without elaborating.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Ah. Well, that&#39;s all right. Shall I send him up when he arrives?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Dr Bennett is a man of middle years with graying hair, a heavy-set frame, and a rather lumpy face. He usually smells of antiseptic and sometimes of gin. Mom lets him into your room without a word, and he sets down a black leather bag on your desk.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Good to see you again, $name,&quot; he says in a kind, gruff voice, adjusting his head mirror. &quot;Shall we see what you&#39;re dealing with?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;He makes you undress halfway, and performs a brief and professional inspection of the key areas of your body. With a grunt, he rises to his feet, gesturing for you to &lt;&lt;if $startsex == &quot;male&quot;&gt;&gt;pull up your pajamas.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;pull up your panties and fix your nightgown.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; &quot;Well, I see what you&#39;re talking about,&quot; he says after a moment, puzzled. &quot;I&#39;ll be dipped if I can figure out why it happened, though. I think I&#39;ll try to find out where I read about that other case. Must have been a medical journal. Don&#39;t think it was the newspaper.&quot; He conks himself genially on the head with one fist. &quot;Getting old, I guess.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;if $path.includes(&quot;polio newspaper&quot;)&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I was reading about polio in the newspaper today,&quot; you say. &quot;Maybe this is some new-fangled disease or other, do you think?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Disease? Hard to say. I&#39;ve never seen a disease like ... wait a minute. Polio, polio.&quot; Dr Bennett frowns. &quot;There was a polio vaccine trial with some odd side effects. I think your mother was a part of it. Maybe — okay, $name, I know you&#39;re anxious to find out what&#39;s happened to you, but this is just a hypothesis, so don&#39;t mention it to anyone. Not yet. I&#39;m probably remembering it wrong. Let me find that old medical journal and look up this case. I&#39;ll call around, too. Maybe Dr Lambert or Dr Phillips remembers the details.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I promise,&quot; you say, holding up one hand, like you do when you take your scouting oaths every weekend.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;\
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;What about school?&quot; you ask. &quot;I can&#39;t go like this, can I?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;That&#39;s a good point,&quot; he says, rubbing the white stubble on his chin. &quot;I tell you what. I can write the school a note that will excuse you from your gym classes. Would that do the trick?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Oh, yes please, sir.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Good,&quot; he says, getting out his notepad. &quot;You just take this with you and show it to your teachers. They can call me if they have any questions. I won&#39;t //tell// them anything,&quot; he adds, seeing the look on your face. &quot;Not unless you want me to.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; he says, shaking his head and sucking his front teeth. &quot;You wouldn&#39;t be able to keep that kind of secret from your parents. Otherwise, what would you wear? Would you change clothes along the way somehow? And the school would have to know why the //real// you has stopped going, otherwise they&#39;d be sure to send a truant officer to talk to your parents and ask why you aren&#39;t at school. If that&#39;s what you prefer, I suppose I can&#39;t stop you, but I don&#39;t know how long you&#39;d get away with a scheme like that. It would fall apart in a day or two, I think. I don&#39;t advise that you try it.&quot; Without waiting for a response, he begins packing his black bag and prepares to leave. &quot;In fact, if you&#39;re going to try a scheme like that, I&#39;d prefer not to know about it.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;&lt;if $page == 10&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I won&#39;t tell the school anything, unless you ask me to,&quot; Dr Bennett assures you. &quot;It&#39;s part of the Hippocratic Oath. The World Medical Association in Geneva just issued a statement about secrecy, only this year. As a doctor, I don&#39;t say any more than is necessary.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Oh, good.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Of course, if I discover that what you have is some kind of communicable disease, and there are other people at risk,&quot; Dr Bennett says, beginning to pack his black bag, &quot;then I would have to tell the King County board of health. But I wouldn&#39;t worry about that right now. Let me look into this condition of yours first, and I&#39;ll let you know what I find out.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;

From 1930 to 1938, a researcher named Horace Kind attempted to produce a polio vaccine, using as test subjects a number of high school students in the area of King County, Washington. These experiments were ultimately unsuccessful in preventing polio, but they had an unexpected side effect. The children of those vaccine test subjects were born with a new kind of dimorphic sex chromosome, designated Z or Zeta.

The Zeta chromosome can transform its shape and chemical nature from X to Y and back, changing an XX into an XY pair, or vice-versa. It rarely does so when this would result in a non-viable combination, such as YY, although this is mostly because I (the author) don&#39;t want to complicate things unnecessarily. Some other author who is better versed in genetics can tackle this variation.

What the Zeta chromosome actually _does_ apart from change biological sex is up to the player. The intention is to permit the player to play through each of the scenarios and keep track of the player&#39;s decisions. The changes wrought by the Zeta chromosome and the way these affect society depend on what the player chooses.

THE CHOICES
There are five basic axes along which the player&#39;s choices matter. Major decisions from each story are added to the saved calculations, which persist across multiple playthroughs. (The player will have the option to wipe the history and start fresh.)

* Sex. Does the Zeta chromosome only affect AFAB or AMAB? If the player always selects &quot;male&quot; to start, then Zeta becomes a condition only of children born and identified as male at birth. The choice of starting character could become constrained to that single sex. If the player chooses a mixture of male and female starting points, the game will allow both AMAB and AFAB characters to be Zetas.

* Social. Does society accept or reject these changes? If the player is more open, more forthright, more bold, and more accepting of the changes, society will shift in that direction. Zetas will get more good publicity as role models emerge on early radio and newsreels, and later in the golden age of television. If the player is more secretive or shameful about these changes, and pushes less against the grain, then society will have a less-good view of Zetas; and Zetas of the future are more likely to conceal their natures or face consequences. The world thus becomes the kind of place that the player creates.

* Orientation. Does the Zeta chromosome change your orientation or sex drive? If the player chooses to engage in new sexual behaviors (for instance, going from hetero male to hetero female), then at least sometimes the Zeta chromosome makes this happen. If the player chooses to remain with one sexuality (eg, hetero male to lesbian female) then the Zeta chromosome is _not_ known for changing orientation. The game will keep track of how often this happens and make assumptions about later characters&#39; sexuality.

* Mental. Does the Zeta chromosome change the way people think? Is the brain itself altered, setting aside matters of orientation? Do Zetas think differently in each state?

* Procreation. Since a Zeta always changes during sex, it makes normal methods of proliferation for the Z chromosome impossible. Therefore, one of two methods must be favored. Either the chromosome is _transmissible_ (you can catch Zeta from somewhere), or the chromosome is _lockable_ (your form can be fixed in one state somehow, either temporarily or permanently).

All of the above contribute to the kind of world the player creates. If Zetas are looked down upon, and the state is Lockable, then Zetas may try to fix themselves in a favored shape. If Zetas are disfavored and the condition can be caught, then the condition might be inflicted on others out of spite, and transgender people may secretly aspire to catch the condition. And so on.
