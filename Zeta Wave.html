	* CYCLE will track what day it is, what part of the day,
	  and which passages are to control events of that day.
	* Each story will have a list of passage names (such as &quot;1941-Day&quot;
	  or &quot;1965-Afterschool&quot;), so CYCLE can direct the game to refer
	  to whatever passages are required. Since not all stories will be
	  set in the same environment -- at work, at school -- each story can
	  thus have its own list of required passages. Stories can also share
	  passages for generic activities (eg, bathing, sleeping) or for
	  certain activities that must share mechanical effects on stats
	  (like working out). The &quot;Working Out&quot; passage from multiple eras
	  can refer to a single Working Out Calculation passage to keep the
	  code in one place.
	* This structure means CYCLE must have a single array that tracks
	  the list of passages, how long that list is, and where we are now.
	  However, it also means that we could (in theory) skip to a new
	  day-part by manually cycling that variable.
	  
There needs to be a SETUP passage for each era.
	* The SETUP passage will establish the list of passages that must
	  be consulted by CYCLE, as well as the starting date and any other
	  relevant details.

There must be a MASTER passage that controls access to the various eras.
	* The MASTER passage will check to see which passages are available
	  and establish links for the ones which are.
	* The MASTER passage may also link to the BOOK, which puts the
	  player&#39;s story into a medical context.
	  
There must be a BOOK which reflects the player&#39;s accumulated decisions and how they affect the future of the Zeta Wave phenomenon. The player can only refer to a BOOK passage after having completed the related scenario.
	* To keep track of the BOOK, I must have a shorthand for outcomes
	  that can be boiled down to a this-or-that variable. For instance,
	  75% of all the players&#39; playthroughs were MTF and ended up in
	  pregnancy, or 95% of all playthroughs changed sexual orientation,
	  or whatever.
	* The BOOK will not have any special interactivity to it, except to
	  be able to reset all the variables (with a warning that this will
	  start the game over from the beginning).

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Oh yeah, I forgot to read my book,&quot; you say, and push yourself out of bed.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;There&#39;s just enough time before the alarm to skim the first chapter of the book. Then Mom knocks on the door. &quot;Get up,&quot; she calls. &quot;Big day to day. It&#39;s Friday.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;&lt;elseif $path.includes(&quot;shameful TG&quot;)&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;The trouble with staying home from school, supposedly too ill to go, is that Mom will probably be here all day. You always hear her complaining about how much there is to do around the house: picking up after Pop and two kids, vacuuming, dusting, going shopping, baking, getting ready for dinner, and so on. She //might// be too busy to sneak upstairs and peek into your bedroom, but then again, she might not. That means you&#39;re going to have to look the part, just in case.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;As long as you stay in bed, you should be fine, but you know you can&#39;t hide here all day. You have to go downstairs, and soon, to ask $fr to collect your homework from your teachers. The minute you get up and go downstairs, Mom is going to notice something is wrong about you. &lt;&lt;if $startsex == &quot;male&quot;&gt;&gt;That gap between your thighs is going to be a problem. Your pajama bottoms don&#39;t do anything to conceal the fact that you&#39;re missing something important.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;That bulge between your thighs is going to be a problem. Your nightgown doesn&#39;t do anything to conceal the fact that you&#39;re packing some new equipment down there, or that you&#39;re missing a few things up top.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; You&#39;re going to need to do something about that.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&lt;&lt;if $startsex == &quot;male&quot;&gt;&gt;Luckily, you don&#39;t have any girly breasts or anything yet, so all you need is a strategic pair of socks.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;Luckily, all it takes is a little toilet tissue to fill out your bra, and a couple pairs of underwear and a girdle to hide the telltale lump.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You creep downstairs, holding your abdomen for theatrical effect, and go into the kitchen to use the telephone. After asking the operator ELliot-6251, you listen carefully for any telltale signs of breathing while $fr&#39;s number rings on the other end.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;At that moment, Mom walks into the kitchen and starts stirring up some Malt-O-Meal for $sibnick&#39;s breakfast. She ignores you, standing in your socks by the telephone, but it still makes you nervous.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Hello?&quot; It&#39;s $fr&#39;s mother.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Hello, Mrs Lenford,&quot; you say. &quot;Can I speak with $fr, please?&quot; You don&#39;t really want to dawdle in the kitchen under your mom&#39;s scrutiny, but you learned good telephone manners through scouting and you can&#39;t just stop now.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;In a minute, $fr comes on the line. &quot;Hello? $name?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Good, you haven&#39;t left for school yet,&quot; you say, and explain about the need for homework. &quot;Could you stop by my classes and pick it up, and then bring it by?&quot; (&lt;&lt;link &quot;footnote 5&quot; &quot;1948 Footnotes&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;set $page to 5&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;/link&gt;&gt;)&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Why, what&#39;s wrong?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Mom is still stirring away at the stove, so you say, &quot;I&#39;m not feeling quite myself. A little under the weather. I&#39;ll tell you later.&quot; At a glance from your mother, you add, &quot;It&#39;s nothing important. I don&#39;t want to make you late for school.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;That seemed to do the trick. Now to go back to your room and try to figure out what&#39;s happening.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;&lt;if $day == 3&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;if $cross == true and $sex == &quot;male&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;The outfit your mother chose for you is a pair of dark blue slacks, a white men&#39;s shirt with red buttons, one of Pop&#39;s blue ties, and a light blue cardigan.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;It all fits pretty well, considering. The white underwear is much more comfortable for your cock than those tight panties you usually wear. The buttons are backward on the shirt, but you figure it all out except the tie, which you aren&#39;t sure how to wear. Fortunately, there&#39;s a section in the Girl Scout guide on knot-tying, so you look up a half-Windsor knot and figure it out yourself. It takes a couple of tries to get the length right, and you still have to tuck the end of the tie into your shirt so it doesn&#39;t stick out the bottom of the sweater.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You check yourself out in the mirror in the upstairs hallway. You look a little rumpled and confused, but not bad. Everything looks just right, except for the long hair. It&#39;s always //something,// isn&#39;t it?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Mom catches you in the hallway. A pair of silver scissors glints in her hand. &quot;All right,&quot; she says. &quot;Let&#39;s cut that hair.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;&lt;set $fhair to 5&gt;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Mom!&quot; you protest.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;You have to stick to the dress code,&quot; she says implacably. &quot;Now come downstairs and we&#39;ll get that trimmed off in a jiffy.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;elseif $cross == true and $sex == &quot;female&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;The outfit your mother chose for you is a pale blue dress with frilly white lace pockets on the skirt. There&#39;s also a pair of black patent-leather shoes, a yellow cardigan, and, of course, the inevitable: a white bra and an unfamiliar pair of panties.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You&#39;re wrestling with the bra when Mom knocks on your door again. &quot;Are you decent?&quot; she asks, sticking her head in.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Mom!&quot; you say, practically naked, wearing only panties, with your arms tangled in the bra straps. &quot;I thought you told $sib not to open doors like that.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I&#39;m your mother,&quot; she says, unperturbed, and points to the bed. &quot;Sit. I&#39;ve got to trim your toenails.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Why? Nobody&#39;s going to see them.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;You have to keep them trimmed or you&#39;ll get a run in your stockings.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Stockings?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;You heard me. The war&#39;s over. Ladies are wearing nylon stockings again. No more bare legs. Not for you, anyway — we&#39;ll talk about getting your legs shaved properly tonight. Now hold still and give me those toes.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;After trimming your toenails, Mom shows you how to roll up a pair of white stockings and unroll them up your legs. &quot;Now you do this one,&quot; she says, handing it to you. &quot;What have you //done// to this brassiere? It&#39;s all twisted into a — oh, there we go.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;After you get the stockings on, she womanhandles the bra onto your body. &quot;You don&#39;t need one, not really,&quot; she notes, &quot;but people will notice if you&#39;re not wearing one, trust me.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;But—&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;if $path.includes(&quot;sock stuffing&quot;)&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;We&#39;ll add a little padding, too,&quot; she decides, stuffing your cups with a modest amount of toilet tissue. &quot;Just so you don&#39;t look so flat. All right, the dress. Arms up!&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;This was your idea,&quot; she reminds you. &quot;I&#39;m just trying to see that you&#39;re dressed for school. Now: arms up.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;\
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;She drops the dress over your head, and you wriggle into the short sleeve holes. &quot;I&#39;ll get the buttons in the back,&quot; Mom says. &quot;It takes a little practice to get them right. Remember, if you have a dress like this with very short sleeves, you should always wear a sweater so you don&#39;t show off your bare shoulders. Oh, and I&#39;ll ask your father if we can pick up a tall mirror for you — you&#39;ll need one to get these buttons on your own. And a vanity, too.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;What&#39;s a vanity?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;A little table for doing makeup.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Do I have to wear makeup?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Yes, you do,&quot; she says, finishing the last button and picking up a sizeable case full of tubes and powders. She starts applying creams and powders to your face, dabbing here and patting there with a fragrant little pouf. &quot;People will notice if you&#39;re not wearing anything. You don&#39;t want anyone to recognize you, do you? I didn&#39;t think so. Now hold still while I do this.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;At last, your face is made up to your mother&#39;s satisfaction. In the mirror, it looks like nothing much at all, considering how much effort went into it. Your skin looks smooth, your lips look pink, and your eyebrows a little darker. Maybe your lashes are thicker from the mascara. You reach up to touch your pink cheeks.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Don&#39;t touch,&quot; Mom admonishes you, smacking your hand. &quot;You&#39;ll get smudges. Now, I&#39;ve got a wig for you, and we&#39;re going to secure it on with bobby pins so it doesn&#39;t fall off. If you&#39;re going to stay like this, your hair will grow out, and we won&#39;t need it any more, but until then you&#39;ll have to be careful, okay?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;When she&#39;s all done with you, there&#39;s a certain Alice-in-Wonderland quality to the girl you see in the mirror: pink, pretty, and puzzled.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You go through your closet, looking for something else to wear that is equal to the concealment you managed to pull off yesterday. &lt;&lt;if $startsex == &quot;male&quot;&gt;&gt;A blazer, some slacks, a nice shirt. A tie.&lt;&lt;if $path.includes(&quot;sock stuffing&quot;)&gt;&gt; An extra sock in your underwear.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; You feel like a bit of an imposter.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;A heavy woolen skirt, a blouse, a sweater. The dreaded girdle.&lt;&lt;if $path.includes(&quot;bra stuffing&quot;)&gt;&gt; More toilet tissue for the empty bra.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; You feel like a bit of an imposter.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Maybe nobody will recognize &lt;&lt;if $path.includes(&quot;shameful TG&quot;)&gt;&gt;you at school.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;at school again today.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; Maybe. But that would take luck, and you haven&#39;t had much of that in the last twenty-four hours.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Mom comes in to check on you, and gives a faint nod of approval. It looks like this is as good as you&#39;re going to get.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;What about scouts?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;We&#39;re skipping today,&quot; Mom says primly, &quot;because of ... $poss[$sgen] //condition.//&quot; She whispers the last word, as if it&#39;s some kind of hex or curse that cannot be spoken aloud.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Pop nods and turns the page on his newspaper. &quot;We&#39;re going to have to sort this out eventually.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;On Monday, dear. What time are you getting started?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Soon,&quot; is his bland answer. &quot;It might rain later, so I want to get an early start.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Mom looks more closely at you. &quot;Did ... did something happen?&quot; she asks. &quot;You look like a $girlboy[$gen] again. Did ... that //thing// happen to you again?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;There doesn&#39;t seem to be much point in trying to deny it. &quot;Yes,&quot; you admit. &quot;Last night.&quot; &lt;&lt;if $path.includes(&quot;SO all the way&quot;) or $path.includes(&quot;friend all the way&quot;)&gt;&gt;You leave out the part about having had actual real-life //sex// and all, because Mom would probably blow a gasket.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;You leave out the part where it was a successful experiment as a result of a date.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Were you //doing// anything?&quot; she asks suspiciously.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;No, I swear,&quot; you say, and think, //I swear she&#39;s got some kind of radar. Do they make radar for moms?//&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Fine,&quot; she says slowly, studying you. &quot;All right, well, maybe it was just a phase you were going through. We&#39;ll tell Dr Bennett on Monday, and see what—&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Do I still have to go?&quot; you ask. &quot;If I&#39;m back to normal—&quot;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Don&#39;t interrupt, $nick,&quot; she says, with a flick of irritation. &quot;Earl, back me up on this.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Don&#39;t interrupt your mother,&quot; Pop says automatically, his face still buried in the newspaper.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Mom takes a moment to give your Pop a look of exasperation across the table, and carries on. &quot;Yes, you&#39;re still going. We don&#39;t know //why// that happened, do we? Or if it&#39;s going to happen again. It&#39;s a shame we didn&#39;t get any pictures,&quot; she adds to your father. &quot;That would have been proof.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Pop nods. &quot;Better pick up some film for next time.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Pictures? That&#39;s the last straw. &quot;Look, it&#39;s fine, Mom,&quot; you say. &quot;I&#39;m all better. Let&#39;s just go to scouts.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;That&#39;s right,&quot; Mom says. &quot;Glad to hear it. I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll manage to get through the meeting. You&#39;ve done very well so far with school.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;So far,&quot; you say.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;A little, I guess,&quot; you admit.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Were you sick? How come you didn&#39;t call me this weekend?&quot; she asks. &quot;We could have gone on a date. If you&#39;re not careful, I might have to find another boy to kiss whenever I get in the mood.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Maybe we should go find a quiet corner and you can prove it,&quot; you say.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Her eyes widen. &quot;Make out? At the school? In a janitor&#39;s closet or something? Oh, don&#39;t tempt me, tiger.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;elseif $sex == &quot;female&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;$name!&quot; he calls, when he sees you in front of the school, and grabs you around the waist, lifting you off the pavement.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Put me down!&quot; you laugh. &quot;What&#39;s got into you?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;He sets you down gently. &quot;I haven&#39;t seen you since last Tuesday at your place,&quot; he says. &quot;I really missed you. We could&#39;ve gone on a date this weekend, too.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;That&#39;s because you never called,&quot; you say, poking him in the ribs. &quot;I can&#39;t always be the kind of girl who calls up boys.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Maybe I //like// girls who call up boys,&quot; he counters, trying to avoid your poking finger.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Oh yeah, like who?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Just you,&quot; he insists, grinning.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I should make you prove it.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Right now? At school?&quot; His grin widens. &quot;I could do that. We could find a quiet room somewhere.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;That&#39;s not a terrible idea, regardless. Thicker layers means people won&#39;t be looking at you as much.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;$fr is studying you, examining your features and your physique. &quot;You look different. Like you&#39;re getting &lt;&lt;if $sex == &quot;female&quot;&gt;&gt;girlier.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;more boyish.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; Is it getting worse?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Yes, it is, I think,&quot; you say. &quot;That&#39;s what the doctor said would happen.&quot; Realizing you hadn&#39;t told $fr about your appointment, you quickly fill $acc[$fgen] in on the details.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;So I was right,&quot; $nom[$fgen] notes. &quot;It&#39;s kissing. So all you have to do is make out with someone, and you&#39;ll switch again.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Yes, unfortunately.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;So wait,&quot; $fr says. &quot;Does that mean &lt;&lt;if $path.includes(&quot;friend date&quot;)&gt;&gt;our&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;your date with $so&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; worked? You changed back on Friday?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Yes. I was //me// all weekend. Then I woke up this morning, and I was a $girlboy[$gen] again.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;\
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Not necessarily. I made out with $so last Tuesday, and nothing happened. Not until the middle of the night.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;$fr looks thoughtful. &quot;I suppose that&#39;s true. But what have you got to lose?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Good point. Are you sure you don&#39;t mind helping me out again?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;if $path.includes(&quot;friend date&quot;)&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Oh, no problem. You&#39;re kind of cute like this. Plus, it worked once, so who knows? It might work again.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Yes, it sure might.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;From what Dr Bennett said, I don&#39;t think you&#39;re going to be able to hide this from everyone,&quot; Mom points out. &quot;Sooner or later, someone&#39;s going to notice.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;We&#39;ll want to tell your scout leader,&quot; Mom goes on. &quot;Maybe we can work something out.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I&#39;ll think about it.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Good,&quot; she says. &quot;I&#39;m glad you&#39;re taking this so well. I don&#39;t have any idea how we&#39;re going to break this to $sib.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;&lt;set $seeing to [3]&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;display &quot;LastSeen&quot;&gt;&gt;

Pop always comes home around six, which means Mom is usually busy fixing dinner in the kitchen, and $sibnick is out playing with her friends. That leaves you free to do a little necking, as long as you don&#39;t get caught. It&#39;s nothing that a couple of sixteen-year-olds wouldn&#39;t be caught doing in 1948. But holy smokes, you had no idea what it was going to lead to!&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;if $sex == &quot;male&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;She&#39;s looking like quite a dish in her plaid skirt with the yellow cardigan and her patent-leather shoes, and she even lets you hold her by the shoulders when you&#39;re smooching so you can feel how fuzzy and warm her sweater is. You can only imagine what her sweater might feel like on other parts of her body. But before anything gets too hot and heavy, she pushes you to the other end of the bed to catch her breath.&lt;/div&gt;

She likes to call you by your nickname, even though your real name is &lt;&lt;textbox &quot;$mname&quot; $mchoice2&gt;&gt;. &quot;Nobody even knows we&#39;re going steady.

Now you just have to find a moment to tell $acc[$fgen] what&#39;s going on with you.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Fortunately, $fr calls the house just before four o&#39;clock, saying $nom[$fgen] has your homework from school.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Your mother, who is listening with half an ear while she prepares a pot roast, says, &quot;Come over? Honey, you&#39;re sick.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I&#39;m feeling a little better,&quot; you say. &quot;It&#39;s aces, mom.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;She gives you a skeptical look. &quot;All right. Now go get dressed. You can&#39;t have friends over in your &lt;&lt;if $startsex == &quot;male&quot;&gt;&gt;pajamas.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;nightgown.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; And if your little friend gets sick, I&#39;m calling $poss[$fgen] parents and telling them why.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;No, Mom, it didn&#39;t,&quot; you admit, turning pink. &quot;It&#39;s still ... the same.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;All right,&quot; she says, withdrawing and wiping her hands unconsciously on her apron. &quot;I&#39;ve already called the school and arranged to talk to the principal later tonight. When your father gets home, we&#39;re going to call him up and explain the whole thing. I hate to interrupt Mr Fordyce with a telephone call between six and seven, but it can&#39;t be helped. After dinner, we&#39;ll try to sort out what else we can do. Oh, and you have an appointment with Dr Bennett on Monday.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Thanks, Mom,&quot; you say. &quot;By the way, is it okay if $fr comes over tonight? I ... I told $acc[$fgen] about what happened, but I said I&#39;d explain everything later after school.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;That&#39;s fine, dear,&quot; she says. &quot;And if $fr needs to use the telephone to tell $poss[$fgen] parents where $nom[$fgen] is, that&#39;s fine. As long as it&#39;s not long distance.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;$nomcap[$fgen] goes to my school, Mom,&quot; you remind her.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;When you arrive home, Mom gives you a happy hug. &quot;How was your first day, $name?&quot; she asks. &quot;Do you like all your classes?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Sure, they&#39;re fine,&quot; you say. &quot;It&#39;s, you know. It&#39;s school.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;You&#39;re usually more excited about school than that,&quot; she says, withdrawing and giving you a look of mild concern. &quot;Well, you&#39;ll probably like them better as the year goes on.

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Thanks, Mom, I will.&quot; you say. &quot;Oh, is it okay if $fr comes over tonight? We haven&#39;t seen each other all summer, and we just wanted to catch up a bit.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;That&#39;s fine, dear,&quot; she says. &quot;And if $fr needs to use the telephone to tell $poss[$fgen] parents where $nom[$fgen] is, that&#39;s fine. As long as it&#39;s not long distance.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Your mother, of course, is happy to see $so, but a little suspicious of $acc[$sogen] as well. &quot;You know about $name&#39;s ... condition?&quot; she asks, wiping her hands on a kitchen towel.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Oh, yes, Mrs $lastname,&quot; $so says. &quot;$name told me.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&lt;&lt;if $path.includes(&quot;reveal TG&quot;)&gt;&gt;&quot;It&#39;s all very peculiar, isn&#39;t it?&quot; Mom asks, glancing at you.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;&quot;Did $nom[$oppgen]?&quot; Mom asks coolly, glancing at you. &quot;I had to find out from $sibnick, $poss[$oppgen] sister. Anyway, it&#39;s very peculiar, isn&#39;t it?&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; You wouldn&#39;t know anything else about it, I hope?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;No,&quot; $so says, and sounds fairly truthful, too.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Mom clearly doesn&#39;t buy it. &quot;I see,&quot; she says in guarded tones. &quot;Well, thank you for bringing over something for $name to wear. &lt;&lt;if $secret == true&gt;&gt;I was going to suggest it myself, but $name didn&#39;t want anyone to find out yet.&quot;&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;I should have called your mother and asked myself, I suppose, but I didn&#39;t think of it.&quot;&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;if $path.includes(&quot;date revealed&quot;)&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;if $sex == &quot;female&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Upstairs, $so shows you what $nom[$sogen] brought. &quot;It&#39;s a dress for tonight, a sweater, and some nylons. Oh, and &lt;&lt;if $secret == true&gt;&gt;I didn&#39;t know if you needed one, so&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;just in case,&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; I brought one of my old brassieres. Do you know what size shoes you wear? I have a couple of pairs that go with this dress. Let&#39;s see if they fit.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Shouldn&#39;t I try on the dress first?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;If the shoes don&#39;t fit, you&#39;ll need a different dress,&quot; $so says. &quot;Come on, let me help you try these on. You don&#39;t have a lot of time before your date.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;But it&#39;s only four.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Already? We have to shake a leg. You still have to have a bath and put on your skin lotion! And then you&#39;ll have to do your makeup — here, let me show you.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;elseif $sex == &quot;male&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Upstairs, $so shows you what $nom[$sogen] brought. &quot;I have a jacket and some trousers, and a nice shirt. I don&#39;t know if the jacket is going to fit, but it might. We should probably check.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;All right,&quot; you say. &quot;Did you bring shoes?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Oh yeah, you should try those on, too. Are you going to have a bath before your date? You probably should. And shave, too.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;My legs? Why?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;No, your face,&quot; $so says. &quot;Remember how you don&#39;t like it when I have stubble on my face, how you say it&#39;s scratchy?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Oh, right,&quot; you say, remembering.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;And I pre-tied this tie for you,&quot; he says. &quot;I usually leave them like this so I don&#39;t have to tie them. Just hold the knot and pull right here, see? Here, let me show you.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;\
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;It takes a few minutes before $so is satisfied that you know your way around your outfit for the evening. &quot;All right,&quot; $nom[$sogen] says. &quot;I have to go. &lt;&lt;if $sex == &quot;male&quot;&gt;&gt;Good luck. Talk to you later?&quot;&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;I&#39;m //dying// to hear how it goes. Call me, okay?&quot;&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;if $sex == &quot;female&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Upstairs, $so shows you what $nom[$sogen] brought. &quot;It&#39;s a dress, a sweater, and some nylons.

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;If the shoes don&#39;t fit, you&#39;ll need a different dress,&quot; $so says. &quot;Come on, let me help you try these on. I have to go soon, and I still have to show you what makeup I brought. Besides, I can&#39;t let you have //all// my shoes.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;elseif $sex == &quot;male&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Upstairs, $so shows you what $nom[$sogen] brought. &quot;I have a jacket and some trousers, and a nice shirt. I don&#39;t know if the jacket is going to fit, but it might. We should probably check.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;All right,&quot; you say. &quot;Did you bring shoes?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Oh yeah, you should try those on, too. And I brought you an extra razor, in case you need one.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I have a razor,&quot; you say. &quot;For my legs.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I know,&quot; he says. &quot;This one is for your face. It&#39;s sharper, probably, so be careful.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;\
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;It takes a few minutes before $so is satisfied that you know your way around your new outfit. &quot;Okay, I gotta scram,&quot; $so says. &quot;Lots to do tonight. Call me on Sunday, maybe we can get together.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;\
&lt;&lt;elseif $path.includes(&quot;friend date&quot;)&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;if $secret == true&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;As soon as you get home from school, you have to solve the problem of what to wear tonight. Your whole //future// could depend on getting this one date right. $fr is going to help you, sure, but only if you dress like a $girlboy[$gen] somehow. There&#39;s only one thing you can do: raid your &lt;&lt;if $sex == &quot;male&quot;&gt;&gt;father&#39;s&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;mother&#39;s&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; closet.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;if $sex == &quot;male&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;When your mother leaves the house to pick up $sibnick from school, you dash into your parents&#39; bedroom and start to go through his things. You know one end of his closet contains his older clothes, the kind of things he used to wear when he came out of the Army and was still very trim. Those might just fit you.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Frantically, you paw through his shirts and trousers, looking for anything that will fit. You manage to find a jacket, a white shirt and a pair of double-knit trousers that aren&#39;t too old-fashioned, and you pick out a matching tie. The shoes are a bit of a problem, but you find if you wear three pairs of socks they fit well enough. You creep back to your room with your stolen wardrobe just as Mom is pulling up in the driveway with $sibnick.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;When your mother leaves the house to pick up $sibnick from school, you dash into your parents&#39; bedroom and start to go through his things. You know one end of her closet contains her older clothes, the kind of things she used to wear when you and $sibnick were younger and she had a trimmer figure. Those might just fit you.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Frantically, you paw through her skirts and blouses and dresses, looking for anything that will fit. You manage to find a simple yellow dress that&#39;s only a //little// old-fashioned, and you pick out a sweater to wear over it. You really want to leave her brassieres in the drawer, because you have no idea what you&#39;re looking for, but you //do// need to look like a girl, and that means you&#39;ll have to have a little something up top. A bra could hold some socks or toilet tissue or something. You also have to take a pair of her nylons. The war is over, and girls aren&#39;t going around with bare legs any more.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;The shoes are a problem. Most of them are a bit too small, and some of the ones that fit have heels. You manage to find a pair of shoes that you can get your feet into, and you creep back to your room with your stolen wardrobe just as Mom is pulling up in the driveway with $sibnick.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;\
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;The real challenge is going to be getting out of the house with this outfit. You can&#39;t expect to just waltz out the front door wearing your &lt;&lt;if $sex == &quot;female&quot;&gt;&gt;mother&#39;s dress,&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;father&#39;s clothes,&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; to say nothing of hopping on your bike and riding down the driveway. You decide to bundle it all up into a satchel and drop it out your bedroom window. If you&#39;re lucky, you&#39;ll be able to grab the satchel, find a hedge or something to change behind, and come back later for your old clothes. It could work.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;As soon as you get home, you have to start getting ready for your date. You&#39;re still not entirely accustomed to dressing like a $girlboy[$gen], and you figure you&#39;re going to need as much time as you can get. Your whole future could depend on getting this date right tonight.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;if $sex == &quot;female&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You just had a bath the night before, but there&#39;s no harm in taking another. &lt;&lt;if $secret == true&gt;&gt;Besides, you&#39;re going to have to shave your legs if this disguise is going to work. It&#39;s too bad you don&#39;t have a wig or something so your hair looks more girly, but that&#39;s the way it goes. Perhaps if you wear a pretty hat, nobody will notice.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;Thankfully, you already shaved your legs, so that&#39;ll save a bit of time, which you&#39;ll be able to use getting the wig on.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;After your bath, you pick out an outfit that looks fairly good: a pretty melon-colored dress with your yellow sweater, some white stockings, and dark brown shoes. It takes a little time to get your makeup right. You&#39;re still not used to it, but you&#39;re getting better.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;elseif $sex == &quot;male&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You just had a bath the night before, but there&#39;s no harm taking another. You seem to have more of a problem with body odor as a boy than you did before. Is that why boys smell so strongly? They just can&#39;t help it?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;After your bath, you check your face in the mirror. You&#39;re not sure what to do with it, since you don&#39;t need to wear makeup, so you give it a wash and feel a little bit scratchy stubble on your chin. Better take a razor to that — very carefully.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;The last thing to work on is your hair. &lt;&lt;if $secret == true&gt;&gt;The trouble is, boys don&#39;t wear their hair long like this, and you don&#39;t want to cut it. After all, how will you continue attending school as a girl on Monday if you chop off your hair tonight? No, a baseball cap will have to do.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;Luckily, your mother cut it nice and short, so it doesn&#39;t take long to dry. There isn&#39;t much you need to do with it except give it a good comb.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;\
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;It&#39;s not a bad outfit, you decide, checking yourself in the hall mirror. Luckily, $sibnick doesn&#39;t notice you preening and studying your reflection.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;\
&lt;&lt;elseif $path.includes(&quot;SO date&quot;)&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;set _havedate to true&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;As soon as you get home, you have to start getting ready for your date. It won&#39;t take hours, thankfully, but you are going to make to make certain your disguise stands up. You have to look like a $girlboy[$oppgen], and you just don&#39;t //feel// that much like one any more.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;if $sex == &quot;female&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You get dressed in your boys&#39; clothing, &lt;&lt;if $secret == true&gt;&gt;which still doesn&#39;t feel like it fits you. The shirt is too baggy, and there&#39;s something missing in the trousers. &lt;&lt;if $path.includes(&quot;sock stuffing&quot;)&gt;&gt;You&#39;re tempted to put another sock down there, but what&#39;s the point? People would just tease you about it anyway.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;You&#39;re tempted to put a sock down there, but people would probably just tease you for it.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;which doesn&#39;t feel like it fits you any more. Your shaved legs feel smooth and sensitive in your trouser legs, and the fabric keeps clinging to your skin.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; You have to wear a couple different pairs of socks to get your shoes to fit.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You get dressed in your girls&#39; clothing, &lt;&lt;if $secret == true&gt;&gt;which still doesn&#39;t feel like it fits you. The dress is snug around the shoulders, there&#39;s an awkward lump beneath the skirt that&#39;s hard to conceal, and you&#39;re completely flat up top. &lt;&lt;if $path.includes(&quot;bra stuffing&quot;)&gt;&gt;You&#39;re tempted to put more tissue paper in your bra, but people would probably just tease you for it.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;You&#39;re tempted to put some tissue paper in your bra, but what&#39;s the point? People would just tease you for it anyway.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; At least you still have long hair, which helps to hide your face a little. Some makeup would also help complete the look, so you don&#39;t look so much like a boy in a dress.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;With your hair cut boyishly short, it doesn&#39;t do much to help the overall impression that you&#39;re just a boy in a dress.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; Maybe, if you squint just right, a boyish-looking girl.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;set _havedate to false&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You arrive home and flop down on your bed, exhausted. It&#39;s been such a strange week.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You want to try to relax and not think about the troubles you had at school, but your thoughts are already turning to your scout meeting tomorrow. How are you going to show up there looking like //this?//&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;What else could I do?&quot; you ask rhetorically.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Sure, sure,&quot; Floyd says. You can hear the sound of his furious scribbling. &quot;Then you started coming to school as a $girlboy[$soppgen]. How did you manage to do that?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;if $path.includes(&quot;known zeta&quot;)&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You explain about the borrowed clothing, and how your mother contacted the principal. &quot;We made sure it was okay first,&quot; you say. &quot;Luckily, the school didn&#39;t give us any static about that.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;There doesn&#39;t seem to be a whole lot you can do tomorrow, at least without making things worse.

That means if you were to transform before the fight, you&#39;re not sure what point it would prove.

Or you could skip the whole thing and go home -- but what if $bully followed you? And even if you could get home safely, what if that wasn&#39;t enough?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;$bully was tormenting you because $nom[$bgen] thought you were small and weak. That&#39;s all it was. Eventually $nom[$bgen] might get bored and turn $poss[$bgen] attention to someone else, but $nom[$bgen]&#39;d be back one day.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;No, the best thing would be to face $acc[$bgen] down and handle the situation somehow. Either fight $acc[$bgen] head on, or find some way to defuse the situation so it never came up again.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;$name, come set the table, your father&#39;s home,&quot; Mom shouts up the stairs.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I&#39;m right here, ma,&quot; you say. &quot;Why can&#39;t $sibnick do it? I&#39;ve got to get ready for the first day of school tomorrow.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Grumbling, you haul four dishes out of the kitchen cabinets and set everything out: plates, forks, knives, spoons, glasses, napkins.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&lt;&lt;if $sex == &quot;male&quot;&gt;&gt;&quot;Did you wash your hands?&quot; Mom asks. She licks her fingertips and tries to smooth down your cowlick. &quot;Go comb your hair. And when $sibnick comes in, make her run a brush through those tangles, too.&quot;&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;&quot;Don&#39;t forget to wash your hands and fix your hair,&quot; Mom reminds you. &quot;And when $sibnick gets in, make her scrub her face. I&#39;m sure she&#39;s got dirt everywhere. Make her run a brush through those tangles, too.&quot;&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;By the time Pop gets to the table, his tie is loosened, his shoes are off, and he&#39;s got the newspaper tucked under one arm and a highball glass with a whiskey and soda in the other hand that Mom made for him. &quot;You&#39;re looking very pretty tonight, girls,&quot; he says to &lt;&lt;if $sex == &quot;male&quot;&gt;&gt;Mom and $sib,&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;the three of you,&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; folding the newspaper under the corner of his plate. &quot;That&#39;s good, at least.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Mother gives you and $sibnick a warning look that says //don&#39;t ask your father about the news.// It&#39;s well known that Pop didn&#39;t care for anything he read in the paper lately. If it isn&#39;t the Russians creeping around, or the French government collapsing again, it&#39;s the specter of Communists like Alger Hiss looming behind every headline. He doesn&#39;t even have the Seattle Pilots to fall back on, &lt;&lt;if $sex == &quot;male&quot;&gt;&gt;because this summer they weren&#39;t much better than //bad//, and the St Louis Browns (his second love) were even worse.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;at least according to his endless grumbling over the sports section this summer.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Today, $sibnick must have missed Mom&#39;s Look, because she asks, &quot;Why, is something bad?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Nothing, sugar,&quot; Pop says to her, but he looks across the table at Mom, taps the newspaper, and mouths the word //polio.// (&lt;&lt;link &quot;footnote 1&quot; &quot;1948 Footnotes&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;set $page to 1&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;/link&gt;&gt;)&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;No, not tonight. Go on, scoot.&quot; Your mother watches $sibnick drag her feet out of the dining room, carrying the remains of her pot roast, until you finally hear her step on the stair treads and the sound of her bedroom door closing.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;You&#39;ve called Dr Bennett?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Yes. $name is going in first thing on Monday.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;elseif $path.includes(&quot;Dot tattled&quot;)&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;The pot roast is a little late getting to the table, given the dramatics this afternoon, but Mom gamely rushes everyone through the meal as quickly as possible.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;All right, $sibnick,&quot; she says to your younger sister. &quot;You&#39;re going to have to take it and finish it upstairs in your room. Your father and $name and I have some things we have to talk about, and you&#39;re in enough trouble already.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Whining, instinctively realizing she&#39;s being excluded from this momentous conversation, $sib says, &quot;C&#39;mon, Mom, can&#39;t I—&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;No, you can&#39;t. You&#39;re skating on thin ice as it is.&quot; Your mother watches $sibnick drag her feet out of the dining room, carrying the remains of her pot roast, until you finally hear her step on the stair treads and the sound of her bedroom door closing.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Something happened to day, Earl,&quot; Mom says slowly, pushing the remains of her pot roast around her plate with a fork. &quot;$name seems to have come down with something.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Polio?&quot; is Pop&#39;s immediate answer, making him look up from the newspaper.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;No. Not polio.&quot; Mom clears her throat delicately. &quot;It seems that, overnight, $name has turned into a $girlboy[$gen].&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Pop stares at her. &quot;You&#39;re kidding.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I&#39;m not, Earl, I&#39;m sorry,&quot; Mom says. &quot;$sibnick found out about it earlier today when she barged into $name&#39;s room. I&#39;ve already spoken to her about it. As soon as I found out, I called Dr Bennett to make an appointment. First thing Monday morning. And I&#39;ve made arrangements to call Mr Fordyce, the principal, before seven tonight.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;During dinner?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;It can&#39;t be helped. I haven&#39;t told him anything yet, but we&#39;ve got to let him know what our decision is.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;\
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Pop grunts, drumming his fingers on the newspaper underneath his right hand. &quot;We don&#39;t know what this condition thing is?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Dr Bennett thought he recognized it from some medical journal or other,&quot; Mom says. &quot;He says it&#39;s probably not contagious, so we don&#39;t need to worry about catching it.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Good to know,&quot; Pop says, his eyes widening a little. &quot;I hadn&#39;t thought of that. Well, what&#39;s left to decide, then?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;We have to decide what to do about school, if this doesn&#39;t wear off and $name is a $girlboy[$gen] for the rest of the year. What about clothing? What about scouts?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I don&#39;t think we should spend a lot of money on clothes.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I&#39;ve made a few calls to some of the other mothers in the PTA,&quot; Mom says. &quot;Families with $girlsboys[$gen], maybe a year or two older than $name. There&#39;s enough hand-me-downs out there, we&#39;ll be able to pick up some clothes tonight if we really need to.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You feel yourself turn a little pale at the idea of showing up to school tomorrow earing $girlboy[$oppgen] clothes.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Look at $acc[$oppgen],&quot; Pop says, glancing at you. &quot;$nomcap[$oppgen] looks like $nom[$oppgen]&#39;s going to be sick. Before you get too far ahead of yourself, maybe you should ask $name what //$nom[$oppgen]// wants.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;&lt;set $seeing to [3]&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;display &quot;LastSeen&quot;&gt;&gt;

&lt;&lt;if $day == 3&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Throughout dinner, $sib keeps pestering you with questions about school. &lt;&lt;if $sex == &quot;male&quot;&gt;&gt;Did you have to go in the boys&#39; bathroom? Was it messy? Did you kiss any girls? Did any girls try to kiss you? Did you get kicked in the you-know-whats?&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;Did you have to go in the girls&#39; bathroom?

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;They did?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Yes. Apparently this reporter&#39;s daughter brought home a copy of your school paper, and you were in it. He wanted to get the story himself.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Oh. Great.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;That&#39;s what I thought, too,&quot; she said. &quot;Maybe if the newspapers are interested, somebody out there will know how to fix this ... this condition of yours. You never know. Anyway, you have to eat something,&quot; she says, spooning creamed corn onto your plate. &quot;You have to eat more than a tiny slice of meatloaf and a spoonful of carrots.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;No, you&#39;re sitting there like a lump on a log. Come on, I worked hard on dinner and you&#39;re going to have more than just a tiny slice of meatloaf and a spoonful of carrots.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Hmm,&quot; Pop says, turning a page.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Mom clears her throat ominously and arches her eyebrows across the table. &quot;Earl.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Pop looks up, blinking. &quot;Oh. Yes. So, did anything interesting happen at school today, &lt;&lt;if $sex == &quot;female&quot;&gt;&gt;girls?&quot;&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;kids?&quot;&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; he asks.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Being a teenager was pretty tough.

Half the time you&#39;re &lt;&lt;if $sex == &quot;male&quot;&gt;&gt;doll dizzy, and you can&#39;t stop thinking about beautiful girls in your class,&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;khaki wacky, and you can&#39;t stop thinking about boys in your class,&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; and the other half of the time you wonder if you should //be// one of them.

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Do you need any Palmolive or Ivory soap for your skin?&quot; she asks. &quot;That Kirk&#39;s Family Soap can dry out your skin.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I&#39;m trying to keep this all a secret, Mom,&quot; you protest. &quot;If I come to school with soft, girly skin, everybody&#39;s going to notice.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;She sniffs, as if to convey her disdain for the horrors of girls with dry skin, and leaves.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;In a few moment&#39;s she&#39;s back, asking if you want to try her shampoo.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Does it smell like flowers? Then no,&quot; you explain. &quot;Please, I&#39;m trying to have a bath.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Um, yes,&quot; you say.&lt;/div&gt;

	When player is MALE
	+1 for every day male (28 max)
	+8 for every makeout session as a male (usu. 1/week, 32 max)
	+2 for each day with a workout (usu. weekdays, 40 max)
	
	When player is FEMALE
	+1 for every day female, first two weeks after menses (14 max)
	+2 for every day female, third week after menses (14 max)
	+4 for every day female, week before menses (28 max)
	+11 for every makeout session as a female (usu. 1/week, 44 max)
	
	EITHER
	+10 male, +10 female, every time player has sex.
	This is because sex is an in-between act for Zetas, and the player
	should be rewarded whether trying to get TO a particular sex, or
	have fun AS a particular sex.
	
	In theory, maximum possible is 100, but certain configurations can
	go up to 114 or so (mostly femininity). Adding in sex takes the
	max up to 140.

PLANNED CHARACTER ARCS
	SO: Your significant other is conveniently bisexual. This means he
	(or she) is willing to continue to date you, on the condition that
	you keep your Zeta status secret. Your SO doesn&#39;t want to be
	outed. At some point, you&#39;ll have to choose between being open
	and breaking up with your SO.
	
	Friend: Your best friend is heterosexual. They will only have sex
	with you when you are in opposite-sex mode (Gary with girls,
	Joyce with boys). Your best friend is willing to have sex with
	you, but doesn&#39;t otherwise want to be seen dating you. This is
	a similar &quot;secretive&quot; route, because basically your friend will
	only participate in &quot;fixing you back to normal.&quot; It only differs
	from SO in the sex of the participant.
	
	Another Zeta: there is always another Zeta you can try to date,
	namely Henry or Arlene. Both of them are capable of being open and
	accepting, although not at first. Neither one wants to be the only
	Zeta, and both have worked hard to keep their condition secret.
	You come along and can bring them into the light, if you try. This
	will require you to break up with SO and not date your friend.
	
	Bully: the bully in the school is also a Zeta and is terribly
	embarrassed about it. You will discover the bully&#39;s secret. If
	you end up dating the bully — the bully has a lot of jealousy
	issues about your openness and insecurity about his/her condition
	— then this is the &quot;ashamed&quot; route. Dating the bully means keeping
	everything on the DL.

	Parents: Earl and Leah.

	PUBLICITY ARC: Early in the game you can do an interview with the
	school newspaper. Because it&#39;s published in a real press, the staff
	gets wind of it and wants to do a &quot;real&quot; interview. This leads to
	the chance to do radio, and to film a newsreel about your
	condition.
		Doing the interview cuts off any chance of dating SO, Friend,
		and the Bully. If you do publicity, the Bully will stay so far
		away that you&#39;ll never discover the secret.
	
	SECRECY ARC: Early in the game you have the choice of creating an
	alternate identity, with or without the school&#39;s cooperation. This
	creates a fig leaf for your alternate self to continue to date SO
	or Friend without exposing them to ridicule. The more you work at
	this alternate ID (via Scouts, via schooling), the more solid your
	potential relationship will be with SO or Friend. The other Zeta
	will be put off by your cowardice.
		The Bully will take advantage of you for it until you discover
		the Bully&#39;s secret, and then will leave you alone.
	
	SHAME ARC: The more you withdraw from society, by skipping school,
	skipping scouts, and dodging the public, the more likely you will
	find support from the Bully, who has a similar problem. The Bully
	used to be popular, but over the past year has become exiled (in
	his/her own mind).


CYCLE ORDER (per day)

	WAKE: When the player wakes up. This often (not always) means we
	run the SexChange script and assess any new changes.
	
	DRESS: Anything that happens before school starts. Conversations
	with lovers, breakfast, getting dressed, traveling to school.
	
	SCHOOL 1: The first half of the school day.
		M Classes: English, Health/Gym, History, Vocal Music
		F Classes: English, Stenography, Health/Gym, Vocal Music
		
		Instructors:
		Bookkeeping (Mr Vanderbilt)
		English (Mrs Hull)
		Geometry (Mr Franklin)
		Health/Gym (Mr Franklin / Mrs Bell)
		History (Mr Lester)
		Home Economics (Mrs Reynolds)
		Spanish (Mrs White)
		Stenography (Mrs Johnson)
		Vocal Music (Mrs Guildford)
		Wood Shop (Mr Thacker)
	
	LUNCH: The break in the middle of the school day, talk with any
	friends or rivals.
	
	SCHOOL 2: The second half of the school day.
		M Classes: Spanish, Geometry, Wood Shop
		F Classes: Spanish, Bookkeeping, Home Economics
	
	AFTER SCHOOL: Doing homework (often very little in 1948), play-
	time, talk with friends. Mom is home during the day, so this is
	not particularly private time, just not directly supervised.
	
	DINNER: Talking over family issues.
	
	BEDTIME: Anything after dinner and before actual sleep. This
	can include nighttime hygiene rituals, taking baths, brushing
	teeth, changing into pajamas, makeout sessions, or dates.
	
	SLEEP: A little afterthought, which can include scenes where you
	go to bed (that is, to fall asleep) with someone else by you.
	
	DREAM: Anything you dream about.

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Oh gee,&quot; he says instantly. &quot;You&#39;re not ... //pregnant//, are you?&quot; His voice dropped to a hush that was barely audible over the buzz of the phone line.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Nothing like that,&quot; you say with a nervous laugh. &quot;No, that night I had this strange dream, like we were about to //do// it, and when I woke up, I was a boy.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;There&#39;s a long silence on the other end.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;A boy?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Yeah,&quot; you say. &quot;It was very queer. &lt;&lt;if $path.includes(&quot;shameful TG&quot;)&gt;&gt;I had to stay home from school yesterday!&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;I had to go to school like that, if you can believe it!&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; And now I&#39;m &lt;&lt;if $newid == true&gt;&gt;having to pretend I&#39;m a cousin named $oppname $lastname.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;trying to keep anybody from finding out.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; It&#39;s most peculiar.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Yes, I can imagine,&quot; he says slowly. There&#39;s another pause, and he says, &quot;Are you pulling my leg?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I wish,&quot; you say. &quot;I could show you, if you don&#39;t believe me.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;No, you don&#39;t have to do that. I believe you.&quot; $so stops again to think. &quot;What kind of condition is this? Is there a cure?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I don&#39;t know yet. I did wonder if there&#39;s a way to change back. If the first change happened because we were making out, and then I had that dream, what would happen if we did that again? Would I go back to the way I was?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;\
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Hey, yeah,&quot; $so says, sudden excitement in his voice. &quot;That&#39;s true. Maybe it&#39;ll just go back to normal, yeah? Maybe it&#39;s just temporary.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;It could be,&quot; you say, although you don&#39;t want to get his -- or your -- hopes too high. &quot;It&#39;s worth a try. What do you think?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;There is a pause on the line. &quot;You&#39;re really a boy?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Just a little,&quot; you say. &quot;I didn&#39;t change much.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I suppose we can try it,&quot; $so says after another long pause. &quot;When?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Tomorrow night, maybe,&quot; you say. &quot;We can just pretend we&#39;re on a normal date. We go get ice cream or something, we go to the park, and we make out a little. Then if anything changes I&#39;ll tell you at school on Monday. No, wait, I have a doctor&#39;s appointment. I&#39;ll call you Monday night.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;All right, sure,&quot; he says, bemused. &quot;Sure, let&#39;s try it. To be honest, I&#39;m a little relieved.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Relieved? Why?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Summer was over and I thought //we// were over,&quot; he said. &quot;I thought I&#39;d done something wrong.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;No, nothing. It was just me.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I see that now. All right, it&#39;s a date. I&#39;ll see you tomorow at school.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Me too,&quot; you say, not sure which question you&#39;re agreeing to more. &quot;I thought we should probably talk.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I agree. You know, I&#39;ve been thinking about it, and it&#39;s really pretty keen what you&#39;re doing.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Is it?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Yeah,&quot; he says. &quot;And maybe I could, you know, lend a hand. Show you around, maybe.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I could use some more shoes.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;What&#39;s with you and shoes?&quot; he laughs, and for a moment, everything is just the way it&#39;s always been between you.

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;A plan for what?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Oh yeah?&quot; he asks. &quot;How?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You reflect for a moment on how oblivious he is, and say, &quot;$fr had this idea that I should make out with //her.//&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Oh, uh-huh,&quot; $so says. &quot;Yeah, she&#39;s cute. I&#39;d go for it.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;You don&#39;t mind?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I kind of like the idea of you two making out,&quot; he says, a guilty tone creeping into his voice. &quot;I dunno. Anyway, it makes sense. If you and $fr go out, and you&#39;re dressed as a boy, nobody would notice anything unusual, right?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;And if you and I tried that, I&#39;d have to dress in my girl clothes,&quot; you conclude. &quot;And I don&#39;t look much like a girl.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Exactly. Besides, kissing girls is fun. You should get a chance to try it.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;It&#39;s not going to become a full-time hobby,&quot; you say. &quot;It&#39;s just an experiment.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Keen,&quot; $so says. &quot;Oh, hey, do you need anything? A jacket and tie, maybe? Some cologne?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Actually, yeah,&quot; you say. &quot;I don&#39;t have anything to wear.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;No problem. I got your six. Should I come over after school tomorrow and drop off some things?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;&lt;if $page == 8&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Well, maybe we could try another time,&quot; you suggest casually. &quot;You know, if I&#39;m still a boy in a few days.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Yeah, that&#39;s cool,&quot; $so says. &quot;Maybe after Monday you won&#39;t have to, though. Let me know how that goes.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;if $path.includes(&quot;friend date&quot;)&gt;&gt;Something occurs to you. &quot;Hey, I don&#39;t suppose I could borrow some clothes? And some shoes?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Yeah, I have lots,&quot; $so says. &lt;&lt;if $secret == true&gt;&gt;&quot;But aren&#39;t you trying to keep it a secret at school?&quot;&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;&quot;But don&#39;t you already have some?&quot;&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Just in case,&quot; you say &lt;&lt;if $secret == true&gt;&gt;lamely. &quot;You know, if my condition gets any worse and I can&#39;t go somewhere dressed as a girl.&quot;&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;lamely. &quot;I don&#39;t have all that much, and some of it&#39;s a little old.&quot;&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Good thinking,&quot; $so says. &quot;All right, I&#39;ll come over right after school and drop some stuff off.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I will. Talk to you later?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;It&#39;s a little awkward, sitting in the booth together, trying to make small talk. $so seems ill at ease.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You ask him what&#39;s bothering him, and he shrugs. &quot;It&#39;s so much easier to talk on the phone,&quot; he says. &quot;I know I say I don&#39;t much like the telephone, but there&#39;s a big difference between sitting at a table together and just //talking.// You stil sound the same, mostly. I guess that&#39;s what it is.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I&#39;m still the same person,&quot; you remind him.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Just treat me like I&#39;m still a girl, if you need to,&quot; you say. &quot;You know how to do that. After tonight, if this works, it&#39;ll all go back the way it was.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;After dinner, you take a walk to the park, and $so holds your hand. It seems smaller than before, or perhaps your hand is just bigger.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Should we try over there behind the bank, near the river?&quot; $so asks. &quot;It&#39;s out of sight.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;It&#39;s pretty out,&quot; you say. &quot;Let&#39;s just enjoy the sunlight for a bit.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Eventually, you make it to the riverbank. There are some footpaths here, and a few logs that have been worn down by a generation of people sitting on them and taking in the evening. $so slips his arm around you and holds you close, and you lean up against him. He smells like soap and Old Spice cologne, and he&#39;s trembling a little.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;It&#39;ll be okay,&quot; you assure him, patting his leg and squeezing his knee.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Yeah,&quot; $so says huskily. &quot;I know. I&#39;ve been looking forward to it, actually.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Then he&#39;s drawing you closer, turning you in his arms, and searching for your lips with his own. You let him kiss you, even as you hold him tight in your embrace and run your hands up and down his strong back. His breath is hot against your skin, your heart is pounding, and his kisses send you soaring.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;As he bestows your face and lips with kisses, and you return them, you can feel your cock beneath your skirt trying to stiffen. It&#39;s trying to break free of the concealing layers of clothing that you wrapped it in. There&#39;s a pleasant pressure as your cock struggles, but also pangs of discomfort as it strains against its confinement. Your cock is powerful and it //wants// something. You aren&#39;t even sure what, but just now you can&#39;t even remember what it was like being a girl.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Are you okay?&quot; he asks you, drawing back for a moment.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Amazing,&quot; you reply. &quot;You?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I can&#39;t believe I&#39;m kissing a boy,&quot; he murmurs. &quot;But it&#39;s ... it&#39;s not bad.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Is it like it was before?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Yeah,&quot; he says. &quot;Same blue balls, too.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;What are those?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;That&#39;s when your dick gets hard and you really want to do it,&quot; he says. &quot;But you can&#39;t.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;That&#39;s me, then,&quot; you say, turning a little pink. &quot;My dick is really hard.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Your—oh yeah,&quot; $so says, and grins. &quot;I forgot. You have one too.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Yep,&quot; you say, trying to adjust your skirts and your legs to give your stiffened cock a little more room. &quot;It&#39;s weird. Feels good, though.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;You know what else would—oh, never mind,&quot; $so says. &quot;Forget it.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;What? Something else that would feel good?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Oh, nothing,&quot; he says. &quot;You&#39;d probably worry about getting a reputation.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I don&#39;t think I //have// one any more,&quot; you say with a grin.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;He grins back, the light of sunset giving his face an orange glow. &quot;Then ... do you want to?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;\
&lt;&lt;if $page == 10&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You and $so retreat into the bushes, hearts pounding, trying to keep the branches from rustling too much. You unzip your skirt and push it down your hips, showing $so the straining bulge that is barely hidden beneath your girdle and layers of underwear.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Gee whiz, you really //do// have one,&quot; $so says, amazed. He reaches out to touch it, and the sensitivity of the contact makes you flinch.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Show me yours,&quot; you whisper to him.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;And he does, unzipping his trousers to show you his own manhood, which is fully erect. It&#39;s only the second penis you&#39;ve ever seen, after your own.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You&#39;ve never done this before — obviously — but you reckon that for your very first time, you and $so manage to please each other pretty well. $so is good with his hands, and he shows you an unbelieveable technique for stroking your cock: a light grip, a steady motion, and backing off the pace when you feel you just can&#39;t stand it any more. It makes his handjob last quite a long time, until finally you feel like you&#39;re going to have to explode, and you push him back, panting.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Then you show him what you&#39;ve learned. In a few minutes, you have him leaned back in the bracken, moaning softly at the touch of your hand, and you keep kissing him while he runs his fingers up your pumping arm.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;In time, when you feel your pleasure can&#39;t go on any further, he rolls over and tugs down his jeans to allow you to have your way with him, and you can&#39;t think of anything you&#39;d rather do than plunge inside. He&#39;s grunting quietly with every stroke, and you&#39;re reaching around for his cock to give him pleasure to match your own rhythm. It all leads to a moment of utter ecstacy as you feel yourself burst open inside him, and at that moment his cock surges in your hand. His shaft becomes slick and you keep stroking, even as your own sensations double.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Then your mind seems to crack, and your body begins to burn. Your flesh feels like it&#39;s being //squeezed//, your bones tremble, your teeth rattle in your jaw, your skin seems electrified, and then ...&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Your throbbing erection is gone. Gone completely.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Through the chill of sweat on your skin, and the quivering remains of your moments of orgasm with $so, you realize: you&#39;re a girl again.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Your legs are a little shorter. Your hands are a bit smaller. Your shoes fit a little better — they&#39;re even a little loose. And, somehow, your breasts are bigger than they were before.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;//What a way to make your bustline develop,// you think. //It&#39;s much better than any lotion or exercise I ever heard of. But somehow I don&#39;t think it&#39;ll catch on.//&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Are you okay?&quot; $so asks. &lt;&lt;if $hair gt 5&gt;&gt;&quot;Hey, your hair grew back a little.&quot;&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;&quot;You look ... different.&quot;&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I guess it worked,&quot; you say. You can&#39;t decide if you&#39;re relieved or disappointed.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Holy cow, I&#39;d say it did,&quot; $so says, looking down between your legs. &quot;Your thing is gone.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Instinctively, you want to cover yourself up, but there almost doesn&#39;t seem to be a point. &quot;Yes, it is,&quot; you say, repeating the obvious. &quot;It&#39;s gone.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Well!&quot; $so says happily. &quot;That&#39;s the berries. We did it!&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;The berries?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;It&#39;s something my dad says,&quot; $so says sheepishly.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Well, you&#39;re right. It worked. Thank you.&quot; You give $so another kiss, then you creep down to the river to wash up a little. Everything has to be in its place when you return home, or your parents will notice something awry.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You don&#39;t get a chance to answer, because he&#39;s put your back to the wall and is pressing up close, planting kisses all over your face.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;It&#39;s wonderful being in his arms again, and you can feel your blood surging in response to his sudden, wild passion. //He&#39;s really into me,// you think, returning his kisses, raising your arms up to his shoulders and twining your fingers in his hair. //What a dreamboat!//&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Careful,&quot; you say between kisses. &quot;Can&#39;t -- too much --&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;So what? It&#39;s just kissing,&quot; he says, and he holds your face in his large, warm hands. &quot;The doctor didn&#39;t say anything about not kissing one every again, did he? Besides, we&#39;ve kissed lots of times.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;That doesn&#39;t sound right to you, but it&#39;s also so difficult to stop. You melt into his body, pressing up against the firm solidity of his torso, adding your heat to his. And you can feel him up against you, too, hard and urgent.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Then his hand rises along your waist and finds your breast through your sweater. The rough, powerful touch of his hand sends a bolt shooting through you. &quot;Wait, don&#39;t,&quot; you say in a strangled voice, trying to speak around his questing lips and push away his hand. &quot;$so, wait --&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;It&#39;s too late.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;The pounding of your blood in your veins seems to reach a dizzying crescendo, pulsing in your brain, and you feel as if your very skull is trying to split in half.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You back away, clutching your middle. Everything inside you seems to be churning like the wheel on a paddleboat. Your bones are twisting. Every inch of skin is on fire.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;And then you feel yourself shifting, spinning, rising as if floating toward the ceiling, squeezed by a giant hand that is forcing your flesh into a new shape.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You&#39;re a boy again.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Oh, shoot!&quot; $so says, breathing hard and backing away. &quot;Did you just--&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Yes, I just did,&quot; you sign. The dizzying, burning feeling is fading.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Oh, gee, $so, I&#39;m so sorry,&quot; he mumbles. &quot;I didn&#39;t know -- but I thought your doctor said --&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I know, I know,&quot; you say, and try to shake your head clear. &quot;I shouldn&#39;t have agreed. It&#39;s my fault, too. &lt;&lt;if $secret == true&gt;&gt;I don&#39;t know what I&#39;m going to do now. Somebody is //definitely// going to notice me now.&quot;&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;What am I going to do now? I can&#39;t go to class like this.&quot;&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;if $secret == true&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I don&#39;t know, I really don&#39;t,&quot; $so says. &quot;Wait, hang on. I have clothes in my locker, if you want. Maybe it&#39;ll help.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Hey, you know what? I have a change of clothes in my gym locker,&quot; $so says. &quot;Just wait here I&#39;ll be right back.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;&lt;if $path.includes(&quot;SO no contact&quot;)&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Great,&quot; $so says. &quot;Now you decide to call. What&#39;s shaking? Is it over between us, or what?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;What are you talking about? I saw you last week.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Yeah, and I haven&#39;t seen you at school or anything,&quot; he says sullenly. &quot;I&#39;ve tried calling but you&#39;re never there.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Belatedly, you realize you&#39;ve never contacted $so and told him what was happening to you. &quot;I have Scouts. And homework. There&#39;s a lot going on--&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I&#39;m sure, yeah,&quot; he says. &quot;School and everything. I knew this was just a summer thing for you all along. Now that school&#39;s back, I&#39;m not cool enough to hang around with.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Look, $sonick, I can explain--&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I have an idea,&quot; he says bitterly. &quot;You can save your explanation for later. I&#39;ll give you a couple weeks to think of something. I bet it&#39;ll be really good.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;There is a click on the other end of the line.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;&lt;set $path.push(&quot;SO dumped you&quot;)&gt;&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Pretty good.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Oh yeah?

Is all of that true?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;You heard right,&quot; you say.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;You want any help?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;No, I don&#39;t think so,&quot; you say. &quot;What are you going to do, hit a girl? You wouldn&#39;t. Not even if it&#39;s $bully.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;So what&#39;s your plan, then?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I was thinking, maybe we should go on a date.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You listen to silence on the line while $so thinks it over. &lt;&lt;if $path.includes(&quot;SO date&quot;) or $path.includes(&quot;SO explained&quot;) or $path.includes(&quot;art room makeout&quot;)&gt;&gt;&quot;You mean, make out somewhere so you can try to change into a $girlboy[$oppgen]? How&#39;s that going to help?&lt;&lt;elseif $path.includes(&quot;SO informed&quot;)&gt;&gt;&quot;Are you saying you want to prepare for a schoolyard fight by making out with me? Look, I may be dumb, but I don&#39;t get what you&#39;re up to. You never did call and tell me what&#39;s going on with you.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; Is that all I am to you? Someone you can neck with whenever you want, but I don&#39;t get to help out when you&#39;re in trouble?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;You would be helping out,&quot; you explain.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I don&#39;t see how,&quot; $so says stubbornly. &lt;&lt;if $openzeta == true&gt;&gt;&quot;If $bully doesn&#39;t like that you&#39;ve got this Zeta thing, changing again isn&#39;t going to make things //better.//&lt;&lt;elseif $secret == true&gt;&gt;&quot;If you&#39;re trying to keep your Zeta thing secret, changing again isn&#39;t going to //help,// is it?&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;&quot;If you&#39;re trying to pretend to be someone else, then showing up to a fight as the other person is just //crazy,// don&#39;t you see?&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; But if that&#39;s what you want to do, I guess I&#39;ll help.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Really?&quot; you ask. &quot;Tonight?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Not tonight. I can&#39;t. I&#39;m trying to work on my music. I don&#39;t want to get kicked out of Marching Band. Tomorrow at school, maybe. After first period.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Oh, perfect!&quot; you say. &quot;Thanks so much!&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;$so seems reluctant to talk.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;What is it?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I read your interview,&quot; $so says slowly. &quot;I can&#39;t believe you told them your name &lt;&lt;if $path.includes(&quot;hide dating&quot;)&gt;&gt;and said you were //single.//&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;and you even told them that I //like// it when you&#39;re a boy.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; What were you thinking?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;if $path.includes(&quot;admit dating&quot;)&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;We said we wouldn&#39;t hide that we were dating. We agreed!&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;That&#39;s //not// what you told them!&quot; $so says angrily. &quot;You didn&#39;t just say we were //dating.// I wouldn&#39;t be upset if you just said //that.// Do you know what people are //saying// to me now?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;We said that we shouldn&#39;t tell anybody we were dating. We agreed!&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;That&#39;s //not// what you told them!&quot; $so says angrily. &quot;I wouldn&#39;t be upset if you just said you couldn&#39;t say who you were dating. But you said you were //single.// Like I&#39;m just a big nobody.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;\
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I&#39;m sorry, I didn&#39;t--&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I&#39;ll help you,&quot; he says, &quot;but after that I think we&#39;d better let things cool down for a while. Go our separate ways. I&#39;m not sure I like all this publicity, all of a sudden.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I was thinking, maybe we should go on a date.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;On a date?&quot; he laughs. &quot;At a time like this?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Well, why not?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You can still hear him chuckling. &quot;You know I&#39;ll never say no. &lt;&lt;if $path.includes(&quot;SO date&quot;) or $path.includes(&quot;SO explained&quot;) or $path.includes(&quot;art room makeout&quot;)&gt;&gt;I just don&#39;t know why you want to try to change into a $girlboy[$oppgen].

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Just trust me,&quot; you say. &quot;I&#39;ve dealt with $bully before.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;All right, if you insist,&quot; he says. &quot;Oh, and hey -- I read your interview in the newspaper. At least I assume that&#39;s you.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;How&#39;d you like it?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I think you did pretty well,&quot; he says. &lt;&lt;if $path.includes(&quot;hide dating&quot;)&gt;&gt;&quot;You didn&#39;t give anything away. You said you were single, which is good, because that way nobody can figure out who you are.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;&quot;You didn&#39;t give my name or anything, so nobody can figure out the article is about you.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; I liked it.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Thank you. I was really nervous.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I can understand that. I would //hate// to be interviewed.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;So, can you meet tonight?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Well, I&#39;m //trying// to,&quot; you say, squirming awkwardly on the bed and adjusting your trousers.

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I&#39;m sure it is,&quot; she says with a smug little smile. What does //she// know about blue balls, anyhow?&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;But it&#39;s probably a good thing, because my kid sister $sibnick is a real pill. If she ever found out we were going steady, she&#39;d tattle on me in two shakes of lamb&#39;s tail. She loves getting me in dutch with the folks.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;That&#39;s what sisters are for,&quot; $sonick smiles. &quot;Anyway, I&#39;d better hit the road. It&#39;s almost five-thirty. Your old man is going to be home any minute.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I&#39;m glad you think so,&quot; $so says with a smile, &quot;but we probably shouldn&#39;t spill the beans to your folks just yet. I bet they&#39;re going to flip their lids when they found out you&#39;re courting a young lady.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Well, I&#39;m //trying// to,&quot; you say, squirming awkwardly on the bed and adjusting your trousers. Being a teenage boy in 1948 meant a permanent case of blue balls from puberty until marriage, unless you got lucky somehow. &quot;It&#39;s just awful tough for a guy, you know, when one minute you&#39;re kissing a gal, and the next minute you&#39;re real hard up.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I&#39;m sure it is,&quot; she says with a smug little smile. What does //she// know about blue balls, anyhow?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Aw gee, $sonick, you don&#39;t know what it&#39;s like,&quot; you complain.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I certainly //don&#39;t.//&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;But it&#39;s probably a good thing, because my kid sister $sibnick is a real pill. If she ever found out we were going steady, she&#39;d tattle on me in two shakes of lamb&#39;s tail. She loves getting me in dutch with the folks.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;That&#39;s what sisters are for,&quot; $sonick smiles. &quot;Anyway, I&#39;d better hit the road. It&#39;s almost five-thirty. Your old man is going to be home any minute.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;&lt;if $page == 2&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You ask the operator for OLive-7076, and listen while the line rings. When $so&#39;s mother picks up, you ask to speak to her, and wait while she goes looking for her.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;She finally picks up. &quot;Hello?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;This is $name.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;if $openzeta == true&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;The line goes quiet for a moment, and then $so says, &quot;Oh, is it?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Yes.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Are you sure? You didn&#39;t look like $name today in Pep Squad.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;For some reason, you feel like you have to apologize. &quot;Look, I&#39;m very sorry, $so. I know you must be feeling upset, and I&#39;m sorry,&quot; you say. &quot;I wish it didn&#39;t have to be this way. Yesterday morning I came down with this very queer condition. I can&#39;t help it if I turned into a girl. That&#39;s just what happened.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Oh my,&quot; $so says, and her voice breaks. &quot;I&#39;m so sorry. You should have said.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I know. I should have called earlier, but it&#39;s been so crazy! But look, I&#39;ve been thinking about it, and I feel sure I know how it happened. The other day, after we made out, I had a strange dream that night. You and I were about to go to bed together.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Ooh, tell me more.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;That&#39;s just it. Nothing happened in the dream. And when I woke up, I was a girl,&quot; you explain. &quot;So I thought, maybe I&#39;ll change back to the way I was if we do it again.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;set $path.push(&quot;SO informed&quot;)&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;What is it?&quot; $so asks.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Well,&quot; you begin slowly, &quot;don&#39;t flip out or anything, but you remember that day when we were making out?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;$name!&quot; she says, in an amused, mock-scandalized voice. &quot;I&#39;m a good girl. I would //never// do that.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Surely not,&quot; you grin. &quot;Anyway, that night I had this strange dream, like we were about to //do// it, and when I woke up, I was a girl.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;There&#39;s a long silence on the other end.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;A girl? Really?&quot; she asks. &quot;In your dream?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;In my actual bed,&quot; you say. &quot;I thought I&#39;d gone nuts. &lt;&lt;if $path.includes(&quot;shameful TG&quot;)&gt;&gt;So I stayed home from school! What else could I do?&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;And I had to go to school like that, because what else could I do?&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; And now I&#39;m &lt;&lt;if $newid == true&gt;&gt;having to pretend I&#39;m a cousin named $oppname $lastname.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;trying to keep anybody from finding out.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; It&#39;s been a strange few days, I tell you.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I&#39;m sure it would be,&quot; she says, with great sympathy. Her voice takes on a sterner note. &quot;You&#39;d better not be pulling some prank on me. You&#39;re serious? Cross your heart?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;And hope to die. I could show you, if you want.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;No, you don&#39;t have to do that. I believe you.&quot; $so stops again to think. &quot;What kind of condition is this? Is there a cure?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I don&#39;t know yet. I did wonder if there&#39;s a way to change back. If the first change happened because we were making out, and then I had that dream, what would happen if we did that again? Would I go back to the way I was?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;\
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Oh, that&#39;s a thought,&quot; $so says, intrigued. &quot;That&#39;s a very good point. You might just go back to normal. We don&#39;t know why you changed, do we? It could be anything.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;It could be,&quot; you say, although you don&#39;t want to get her -- or your -- hopes too high. &quot;It&#39;s worth a try. What do you think?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;There is a pause on the line. &quot;You&#39;re really a girl?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Just a little,&quot; you say. &quot;I didn&#39;t change much.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Then I suppose we could give it a try,&quot; $so says after another long pause. &quot;When?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Tomorrow night, maybe,&quot; you say. &quot;We can just pretend we&#39;re on a normal date. We go get ice cream or something, we go to the park, and we make out a little. Then if anything changes I&#39;ll tell you at school on Monday. No, wait, I have a doctor&#39;s appointment. I&#39;ll call you Monday night.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Perfect,&quot; she says. &quot;I can&#39;t wait!&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Really? Why?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I always like seeing you,&quot; $so says happily. &quot;Even if you&#39;re not exactly you right now. I could get used to you like this. Not for — not for getting //married,//&quot; she adds. &quot;But you know. A girl doesn&#39;t //always// have to do that these days.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I suppose you&#39;re right.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I&#39;m always right. Anyway, take care. I&#39;ll see you tomorow at school.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;How?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;You get to see what it&#39;s like, being a girl. I mean, who gets to do that? Other than girls. And maybe I could, you know, lend a hand.

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;It could also be me and you.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;&lt;if $page == 7&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Actually, I&#39;ve already got a plan,&quot; you explain.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;&lt;set $path.push(&quot;SO helping on date&quot;)&gt;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;A plan for what?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;On how to change back.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;It&#39;s a little alarming how quickly her mind leaps to the correct conclusion. &quot;You&#39;re going on a date with someone else, aren&#39;t you?&quot; she asks, raising her voice. &quot;I can&#39;t believe it. Who is it? Is it $fr?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; you say immediately. &quot;It was his idea. And I thought it would be a lot easier to try making out with a boy, because I already //look// like a girl, mostly. If anyone saw //us// hanging out together or making out, they might think //you// liked kissing girls, and I know you don&#39;t want to get a bad reputation.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I suppose you&#39;re right,&quot; $so says, and retreats back to her normal voice almost as quickly as she had raised it. &quot;That&#39;s very sensible, really. I&#39;m still upset with you, though, $name.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I&#39;m sorry, I didn&#39;t mean to upset you.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Well, I&#39;m not //that// upset, exactly,&quot; she says. &quot;I guess I&#39;m a little confused. But I know you must be //twice// as confused. I shouldn&#39;t take it out on you. Part of me is jealous that you&#39;re making out with somebody else, but part of me thinks you and $fr would be kind of cute together.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I&#39;m not going //out// with him,&quot; you say. &quot;It&#39;s just an experiment.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;You&#39;ll have to tell me how it goes,&quot; $so says. &quot;Do you need anything? Any clothes? A cute dress? I can help you with that.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Um, yeah,&quot; you say. &quot;I don&#39;t have anything to wear.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Well, let //me// take care of that,&quot; $so says happily. &quot;When is your date? Tomorrow? I&#39;ll come over after school. I can&#39;t stay long, but I can get you set up.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;display &quot;CleanReturn&quot;&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;\
&lt;&lt;if $page == 8&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Well, maybe we could try another time,&quot; you suggest casually. &quot;You know, if I&#39;m still a girl in a few days.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;That&#39;s a good idea,&quot; $so says. &quot;Let me know what the doctor says on Monday, okay?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;if $path.includes(&quot;friend date&quot;)&gt;&gt;Something occurs to you. &quot;Hey, I don&#39;t suppose I could borrow some clothes? And some shoes?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Whatever you need,&quot; $so says. &lt;&lt;if $secret == true&gt;&gt;&quot;But why? I thought you were trying to keep it a secret at school.&quot;&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;&quot;But why? Didn&#39;t you already find some?&quot;&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Just in case,&quot; you say &lt;&lt;if $secret == true&gt;&gt;lamely. &quot;You know, if my condition gets any worse and I can&#39;t go somewhere dressed as a boy.&quot;&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;lamely. &quot;You can never have too many clothes.&quot;&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;That&#39;s true,&quot; $so says. &quot;All right, I&#39;ll come over right after school with some clothes you can wear. I can&#39;t stay long, but I can get you set up.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I will,&quot; you promise her. &quot;Talk to you later?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Definitely,&quot; she says. &quot;Good luck with school!&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;\
&lt;&lt;display &quot;CleanReturn&quot;&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;\
&lt;&lt;if $page == 9&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You eat dinner with $so at Ivar&#39;s Seafood, splitting an order of fish and chips — breaded cod with plenty of French fries for you both to nibble on.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;It&#39;s a little awkward, sitting in the booth together. $so sits across from you, and she keeps grinning at you. It&#39;s a superior sort of grin, like she knows something you don&#39;t. You suppose that&#39;s about the way of it, too. You only just joined her on the female side of the fence, and maybe she&#39;s entitled to gloat just a little.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;You think this is a barrel of laughs, don&#39;t you?&quot; you ask. &quot;You&#39;re just tickled pink, I can tell.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I don&#39;t know what you //mean,//&quot; she says, all wide-eyed and innocent. &quot;Me? Enjoying myself?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;You //are,//&quot; you insist, and you have to break into a smile, too. &quot;I don&#39;t see what&#39;s so funny about all this.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;She leans across the table and lowers her voice. &quot;I know your secret. You&#39;re a girl like me, now.&quot; She leans back and puts on a smug look. &quot;All the time we&#39;ve been dating, I&#39;ve been just a little worried. A girl&#39;s entitled to worry. It&#39;s not //you,//&quot; she explains, &quot;just worry about boys in general. What boys can do. Being bigger. Being stronger. Getting a girl pregnant. But I&#39;m not worried any more.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Glad to hear it,&quot; you grumble.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;You could be really pretty, too,&quot; $so says excitedly. &quot;You know, a little makeup here and there, maybe a wig or something. You&#39;d never know.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Are you trying to make me feel better or worse?&quot; you ask. &quot;Just try to keep your hat on, all right? After tonight, if this works, it&#39;ll all go back the way it was.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;After dinner, you take a walk to the park, and $so holds your hand. Her hand used to seem so small in yours. Now they&#39;re the same size.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I usually see couples going over there by the river,&quot; $so says, pointing to a line of shrubs.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Aren&#39;t you hot to trot?&quot; you say jokingly, giving her hand a squeeze. &quot;A girl could get a bad reputation.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Are you talking about me or you?&quot; she quips back.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Eventually, you make it to the riverbank. There are some footpaths here, and a few logs that have been worn down by a generation of people sitting on them and taking in the evening. $so sits down and crowds up close so you have to put your arm around her. She leans up against you, and you can smell something delicate and floral.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;You smell nice,&quot; you tell her.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;So do you,&quot; she replies. &quot;I liked the way you smelled before, but this is good, too.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Gee, I&#39;m so nervous,&quot; you say, shuddering a little. &quot;I can&#39;t believe we&#39;re doing this.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Me neither,&quot; she says, turning to you. &quot;Come on. Aren&#39;t you going to kiss me?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Then you&#39;re holding each other tightly, letting your soft lips meet together in the middle. Her kisses feed a growing warmth inside your belly that makes you feel limp and helpless, and you feel yourself want to go passive in $so&#39;s embrace, but you also want to kiss her back. Your breath starts coming faster and faster, and your tiny hands clutch at her back and twine in her long hair. Your heart pounds in your chest. The taste of your girlfriend&#39;s lips is divine.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;As you exchange passionate kisses — on the lips, on the cheek, roaming to the hollow of the throat, then up to just below the ear, feeling her hot breath everywhere on you — you can feel your panties growing hot and damp within your trousers. You want to slide your thighs together, to create some rubbing, to satisfy that empty //hunger// down there. You aren&#39;t even sure what your body needs, but just now you can&#39;t even remember what it was like being a boy.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Oh, boy, I&#39;m getting too hot,&quot; you say through your labored breaths, and you push $so gently back.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;She looks into your eyes, and you see a glimmer of mischief. &quot;So how do you like kissing as a girl?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I like it,&quot; you say, putting one hand modestly to your throat. &quot;It&#39;s really //working.// How about you? Are you ... okay?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;More than okay. Are you getting as turned on as I am?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I think so. I don&#39;t think I&#39;m hard or anything,&quot; you say, glancing down. &quot;I can&#39;t really tell.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Girls don&#39;t get hard, silly,&quot; $so tells you. &quot;Do you feel like your underwear is a little wet?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You nod uncertainly. &quot;I think so. Should we keep going?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;$so grins. &quot;I&#39;m game if you are.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;\
&lt;&lt;if $page == 10&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You and $so retreat into the bushes, hearts pounding, trying to keep the branches from rustling too much. You unzip your trousers, showing her the embarrassing absence in your underwear where your manhood used to be.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;My stars, it&#39;s true,&quot; $so says, amazed. &quot;I wasn&#39;t sure before. But you really //did// turn into a girl, didn&#39;t you?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I told you,&quot; you say. &quot;Now you.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You help her get her skirt off, and you can see her pink cotton underwear. Then those come down, and you see a little peek of pubic hair between her legs. A week ago you would have given ten dollars to see what you&#39;re seeing now, but it&#39;s a little too late. You&#39;ve got a little patch of pussy just like it.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You&#39;ve never done this before — obviously — but you reckon that for your very first time, you and $so manage to please each other pretty well. $so can tell you have no idea where to begin, so she shows you the way by leaning her head down into your lap. She tucks her hair back and rests her head between your thighs, and starts to probe at your pussy with her tongue. You&#39;re too surprised to cry out when her questing tongue finds that little magic button near the apex and starts drawing circles and arcs around it, this way and that. Then you feel two fingers part your pussy and slip right inside you. You bite your lip and clamp your eyes shut, not daring to make a sound.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You can&#39;t believe the sensations that you&#39;re feeling, and you really want $so to feel them too, so you bend in the direction of $so&#39;s thighs and try to do to her whatever she&#39;s doing with you.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;It&#39;s like — it&#39;s like — you&#39;ve never played an instrument, but you imagine it&#39;s like jazz. Or like a drum circle, or an amazing new game — like singing a song around a campfire — all of those things, but a hundred times better. It&#39;s an ecstasy of give and take, of generosity and response. She does something to you and it blots out your brain for a moment, and you try the same on her, and hear the answering moans. You try something new, and she shows you exactly how it feels in return. She kisses your clitoris, so you kiss hers. Tease with the tongue, get a tease back.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;The excitement fills you until you can no longer stand it, and you feel like your whole body is sizzling. Your fingertips are tingling, your spine is electrified, your skin seems to ripple with sheer delight. Then it //does// reach a crescendo, and your entire body pulses with it.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Then your mind seems to crack, and your body begins to burn. Your flesh feels like it&#39;s being //stretched//, your bones tremble, your teeth rattle in your jaw, your skin seems electrified, and then ...&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;The whole-body sensation of tingling delight fades away, and $so is lying beside you, breathing hard.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Through the chill of sweat on your skin, and the quivering remains of your moments of encounter with $so, you realize: you&#39;re a boy again.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Your legs are a little longer. Your hands are a bit bigger. Your shoes don&#39;t fit — they have become a little too tight. And your cock is back where it always used to be. It might even be sightly bigger than before.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;//I bet a lot of guys would kill for that little secret,// you think. //But somehow I don&#39;t think it&#39;ll catch on.//&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Oh, you&#39;re back!&quot; $so says with a delighted little laugh, grabbing your limp cock. &quot;It worked!&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Yeah, I guess so,&quot; you say. You can&#39;t decide if you&#39;re relieved or disappointed.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;You guess? There&#39;s no guessing.&quot; $so sits up and takes in the changes in your body. &quot;Looks like you //can// switch back that way. Isn&#39;t that a hoot?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Instinctively, you want to cover yourself up, but there almost doesn&#39;t seem to be a point. &quot;Yeah, I suppose.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Oh, don&#39;t be a sour pickle,&quot; $so says happily. &quot;We did it!&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;You&#39;re right. It worked. Thank you.&quot; You give $so another kiss, then you creep down to the river to wash up a little. Everything has to be in its place when you return home, or your parents will notice something awry.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Yes, it was fine,&quot; you say.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Have you worn it out yet? You know, out to dinner with your folks or something?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I haven&#39;t gone anywhere,&quot; you lie. &quot;I just wanted to thank you for--&quot; You stop. There was a click on the line. &quot;Hello?&quot; you ask. &quot;Mrs Templeton, is that you?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Oh, you remembered?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Of course,&quot; she says. &quot;So how&#39;d it go? What&#39;d he say?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;elseif $path.includes(&quot;SO date&quot;)&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Hi, gorgeous,&quot; she says brightly as soon as she comes on the line. &quot;Did it work? Our date?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;&lt;set $path.push(&quot;SO date report&quot;)&gt;&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Oh, yes, definitely. It worked,&quot; you assure her. &quot;But I need to tell you about my appointment today.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Hi,&quot; she says brightly as soon as she comes on the line. &quot;How was your appointment?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Oh, you remembered?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Of course,&quot; she says. &quot;So how&#39;d it go? What&#39;d he say?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;\
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Apparently it&#39;s something I got from my mom,&quot; you say. &quot;Some kind of vaccine they were testing and it went all funny. So now this is going to keep happening to me, I guess.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Oh, that&#39;s very interesting,&quot; she says, and she sounds it. &quot;I&#39;m jealous.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Are you serious? Jealous?&quot; you ask, stifling a laugh so your mother doesn&#39;t hear. &quot;I&#39;m going to keep turning into a //girl.// Don&#39;t you get it?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Of course I get it,&quot; $sonick says primly. &quot;I&#39;d love to be able to do that myself. I mean, I //am// a girl, but you catch my drift. Who wouldn&#39;t want to? Besides, you&#39;re cute, you get to wear pretty clothes, &lt;&lt;if $path.includes(&quot;SO date&quot;)&gt;&gt;and you&#39;re heaps of fun to kiss.&quot;&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;and you still look very kissable. What else could a girl ask for in a boyfriend?&quot;&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I have to be careful about that,&quot; you say, laughing. &quot;Too much kissing and I might just switch back again.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;display &quot;CleanReturn&quot;&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;\
&lt;&lt;if $page == 16&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;The Art Room is always empty during first period. You and $so find the door unlocked and slip inside, switching the lights off. The room smells of plaster, tempera paint, and damp clay, and the walls are adorned with dozens of pieces of art from students in years past.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;&lt;set $mlikesgirls += 5&gt;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Where--&quot; you start to ask.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Who cares?&quot; $so asks, grabbing your tie and pulling you to one side of the door. &quot;Right here is good.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You don&#39;t get a chance to answer, because she&#39;s put her back to the wall and hauled you close, and now she&#39;s planting kisses all over your face.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;It&#39;s wonderful having her in your arms again, and you can feel your blood surging in response to her sudden, wild passion. //She&#39;s really into me,// you think, kissing her, slipping your arms around her waist and pulling her body closer to yours as, in your trousers, your cock stirs to life. //What a girl!//&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Careful,&quot; you say between kisses. &quot;Can&#39;t -- too much --&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;if $path.includes(&quot;SO all the way&quot;)&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;We&#39;re not //doing it,// silly,&quot; she says, and she holds your face in her tiny hands. &quot;Nothing&#39;s going to happen, remember?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;It&#39;s just a little kissing,&quot; she says, and she holds your face in her tiny hands. &quot;The doctor didn&#39;t say you can&#39;t ever kiss //anyone.// We&#39;ve kissed lots of times, remember?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;\
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;That doesn&#39;t sound right to you, but it&#39;s also so difficult to stop. You hold her tightly against you, feeling every soft curve of her lush young body.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;And she can feel you against her, too. &quot;Ooh, is that what I think it is?&quot; she asks, grinning wickedly and reaching down to the bulge in front of your trousers.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;When her hand finds your cock through your trousers, the sudden, delicate caress of her fingers sends a bolt shooting through you. &quot;Wait, don&#39;t,&quot; you say in a strangled voice, trying to speak around her questing lips. &quot;$so, wait --&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;It&#39;s too late.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;The pounding of your blood in your veins seems to reach a dizzying crescendo, pulsing in your brain, and you feel as if your very skull is trying to split in half.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You back away, clutching your middle. Everything inside you seems to be churning like the wheel on a paddleboat. Your bones are twisting. Every inch of skin is on fire.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;And then you feel yourself shifting, spinning, dropping toward the ground, squeezed by a giant hand that is forcing your flesh into a new shape.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You&#39;re a girl again.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Gee whiz,&quot; $so says, breathing hard. Her hands have flown up to cover her mouth in horror. &quot;Did you just--&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Yes, I just did,&quot; you grunt. The dizzying, burning feeling is fading.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Oh, gee, I&#39;m sorry,&quot; she says. &quot;I didn&#39;t know -- but I thought your doctor said --&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I know, I know,&quot; you say, and try to shake your head clear. &quot;I shouldn&#39;t have agreed. It&#39;s my fault, too. &lt;&lt;if $secret == true&gt;&gt;I don&#39;t know what I&#39;m going to do now. Somebody is //definitely// going to notice me now.&quot;&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;What am I going to do now? I can&#39;t go to class like this.&quot;&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;if $secret == true&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I think you&#39;re just going to have to risk it,&quot; $so says. &quot;Wait here. I might be able to get you something from my locker that will help.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Don&#39;t worry, I have a change of clothes in my gym locker,&quot; $so says. &quot;Just wait here, I&#39;ll go see what I have.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;

That&#39;s why you&#39;re calling, right?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;What are you talking about? I saw you last week.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;That was a week ago. And since then, you&#39;ve gone on radio silence. I haven&#39;t even seen you at school,&quot; she says sullenly. &quot;You&#39;re breaking up with me.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Belatedly, you realize you&#39;ve never contacted $so and told her what was happening to you. &quot;I have Scouts. And homework. There&#39;s a lot going on--&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I&#39;ve been busy too,&quot; she says. &quot;Just //so// busy, what with school and everything. I haven&#39;t had //time// for a boyfriend. Not that my boyfriend had any time for me.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Look, $sonick, I can explain--&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Don&#39;t //look $sonick// me,&quot; she says waspishly. &quot;If you wanted to break up with me last Tuesday, you could have said so, instead of feeling me up in your bedroom and then just //not calling.//&quot;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Pretty good.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I heard about $bully,&quot; she says. &quot;I heard a lot of things, but it was mostly confusing. There was something about how $nom[$bgen] wants to beat you up after school tomorrow, &lt;&lt;if $path.includes(&quot;SO explained&quot;)&gt;&gt;and how $nomcap[$bgen] figured out you&#39;ve got this&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;and how $nomcap[$bgen] said you had this&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; new Zeta thing that&#39;s going around. Is that for real?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;That&#39;s what $bully said,&quot; you say.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Is there anything I could do? Have you told the principal? Maybe you should let your teachers know what he said.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;That probably won&#39;t help,&quot; you say. &quot;$bully won&#39;t stop for anything like that.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I&#39;m so sorry,&quot; she says. &quot;There must be //something// you can do.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Actually, I was thinking we should go on a date.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You listen to silence on the line while $so thinks it over. &lt;&lt;if $path.includes(&quot;SO date&quot;) or $path.includes(&quot;SO explained&quot;) or $path.includes(&quot;art room makeout&quot;)&gt;&gt;&quot;You mean, make out somewhere so you can try to change into a $girlboy[$oppgen]?

I don&#39;t get what you think you&#39;re up to. You never did call and tell me what&#39;s going on with you.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; Is that all I am to you? Just a girl you can neck with whenever you want, but I don&#39;t get to help out when you&#39;re in trouble?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;You would be helping out,&quot; you explain.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I don&#39;t see how,&quot; $so says stubbornly. &lt;&lt;if $openzeta == true&gt;&gt;&quot;If $bully doesn&#39;t like that you&#39;ve got this Zeta thing, changing again isn&#39;t going to make things //better.//&lt;&lt;elseif $secret == true&gt;&gt;&quot;If you&#39;re trying to keep your Zeta thing secret, changing again isn&#39;t going to //help,// is it?&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;&quot;If you&#39;re trying to pretend to be someone else, then showing up to a fight as the other person is just //crazy,// don&#39;t you see?&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; But if that&#39;s what you want to do, I guess I&#39;ll help.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Really?&quot; you ask. &quot;Tonight?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Not tonight. I can&#39;t. I&#39;m trying to work on my drill moves. I don&#39;t want to get kicked out of Pep Squad. Tomorrow at school, maybe. After first period.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;That sounds good,&quot; you say. &quot;I appreciate it.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;$so seems reluctant to talk.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;What&#39;s up?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Well.

&lt;&lt;if $path.includes(&quot;admit dating&quot;)&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;We said we wouldn&#39;t hide that we were dating. We agreed!&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;That&#39;s //not// what you told them!&quot; $so says angrily. &quot;You didn&#39;t just say we were //dating.// I wouldn&#39;t be upset if you just said //that.// Do you know what people are //saying// to me now?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;We said that we shouldn&#39;t tell anybody we were dating. We agreed!&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;That&#39;s //not// what you told them!&quot; $so says angrily. &quot;I wouldn&#39;t be upset if you just said you couldn&#39;t say who you were dating. But you said you were //single.// Do I not matter to you at all?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;\
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I&#39;m sorry, I didn&#39;t--&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I&#39;ll help you,&quot; she says, &quot;because you asked, and because I can&#39;t stand $bully. After that, I think we should take a step back. Give ourselves a little break from all of this. Suddenly I feel like there&#39;s a spotlight on me, and I don&#39;t much like it.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Pop sighs and says, &quot;Just an article I saw in the paper. A woman flew up from California to be with her son before ... before the end. But polio got the little boy first.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Oh, dear,&quot; says Mom, clutching her throat.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Yes, I know,&quot; Pop says, sighing again. &quot;When are they finally going to lick this thing, that&#39;s what I want to know. They&#39;ve been working on that vaccine for, what? Ten years now? Eleven?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Seventeen,&quot; says Mom, glancing at you. &quot;I remember, because it was right before we got married and had $name. They had this doctor come to our school when I was a senior. Part of a vaccination trial. It didn&#39;t work, of course. A couple of the volunteers got polio anyway.

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Pop rolls his eyes. &quot;Oh, yes, I&#39;m sure. Taking their sweet time, that&#39;s what I call it. I&#39;m telling you, we never would have taken this long in the Army. We&#39;d have gone in and got the job //done.// No nonsense, no sir.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Yes, dear.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Speaking of getting the job done,&quot; Pop says, putting down his fork.

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;No, it&#39;s — it&#39;s something weird,&quot; you say, and you &lt;&lt;if $startsex == &quot;male&quot;&gt;&gt;pull down your pajamas a little&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;lift up your nightgown a little&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; to show her what you mean.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Well, that&#39;s—&quot; she begins, and stops. &quot;My goodness! What happened? Did — did Dr Bennett make a mistake when you were—?

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Not Pop, please,&quot; you beg her. Even your voice sounds a little different. Not much, but a little &lt;&lt;if $startsex == &quot;male&quot;&gt;&gt;higher&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;deeper&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; than yesterday.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;When Pop arrives, Mom has to tell him the whole thing, including her muddled half of the conversation, in excruciating detail while you stand in the bathroom turning redder and redder.

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;It just happened, Pop,&quot; you say. &quot;This morning. Or maybe last night. I had a really weird dream, and I woke up like this. I — I&#39;m not exactly sure //when// it happened.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;What did you dream about?&quot; Mom asks.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;She stares at you for a moment, clucking her tongue. &quot;I guess there&#39;s nothing we can do about it right now,&quot; she says. &quot;You&#39;ll just have to go to school like that.

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;When you&#39;ve had a moment to use the toilet — an all-new experience you&#39;re not likely to forget in a hurry — you scuttle back to your bedroom, hop in bed, and pull the blankets up to your nose. Eventually Mom passes your bedroom door with an armful of laundry and knocks one-handed. &quot;$name, time to get up for school.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I don&#39;t feel well this morning,&quot; you moan, trying to sound extra pathetic. Your voice seems a little different — not much, just a little &lt;&lt;if $startsex == &quot;male&quot;&gt;&gt;higher&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;deeper&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; than yesterday. &quot;I don&#39;t think I can go.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;We&#39;ll see,&quot; was her answer.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Of course, there was no fever, but she insisted on calling Dr Bennett anyway. The doctor must not have said anything conclusive, because Mom let you stay in bed. &quot;You&#39;d better go downstairs and telephone one of your friends and ask them to bring your homework over for you. I&#39;ll make chicken soup for lunch,&quot; she offers. &quot;That should settle your stomach. If that doesn&#39;t help, I&#39;ll bring up some castor oil.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;No, mama, I //saw// it,&quot; she says plaintively.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;And why were you able to see it?&quot; Mom asks in a shrewd voice. &quot;Why was $sibnick able to see anything at all? Were you showing it to $fr upstairs in your room? Were you thinking about playing Doctor with your little friend?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Mom, I wasn&#39;t playing Doctor!&quot;&lt;/div&gt;

That&#39;s what family is //for.// Now first thing, we really need to call Dr Bennett and tell him what happened.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; And of course we&#39;ll have to tell the school. I&#39;m sure I have Mr Fordyce&#39;s number around here somewhere. He&#39;s still the principal, right?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Do we have to tell everybody?&quot; you ask.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Yes. We&#39;ll discuss it tonight over dinner,&quot; Mom says with finality. &quot;When your father gets home. I&#39;m sure that&#39;s what he&#39;s going to decide.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;And as for you, little lady,&quot; Mom says to $sibnick, grabbing her skinny arm sharply, &quot;you don&#39;t go barging in on people when they have the door closed. That&#39;s very rude. I&#39;ll be sure to tell your father about that, too.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;&lt;if $page == 10&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I think we should tell the school what happened,&quot; you say, a little bit of the &lt;&lt;if $startsex == &quot;male&quot;&gt;&gt;Boy&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;Girl&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; Scout honesty rising in you. &quot;They&#39;re going to have to know eventually. Maybe they could help us.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;That&#39;s a good idea,&quot; Pop says. &quot;What kind of help did you have in mind?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Well, you know,&quot; you say, guessing aloud. &quot;If we tell them what happened, maybe I don&#39;t have to do gym class with the rest of the $girlsboys[$oppgen]. I could do something else instead. Or maybe they&#39;d led me go to the school as a $girlboy[$gen] until it ... it, you know, I stop being one. I mean, it&#39;s not //my// fault this happened, right? They can&#39;t get too mad at me.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Let a $girlboy[$oppgen] into the school wearing $girlboy[$gen] clothes?&quot; Pop asks suspiciously. &quot;Gym classes and everything?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;We&#39;d write the school a note about gym class,&quot; Mom says. &quot;If they would accept that.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;And if they don&#39;t?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Maybe we ask the school to enroll $name under some other name, like &lt;&lt;if $startsex == &quot;male&quot;&gt;&gt;$fchoice.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;$mchoice.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; We could say $nom[$gen]&#39;s a cousin that&#39;s staying with us, and maybe the school would play along.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;&lt;if $page == 11&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I don&#39;t think we should tell the school,&quot; you say, imagining the horrors in store if anybody in the principal&#39;s office let your secret slip. Oh, the teasing you&#39;d get! &quot;I don&#39;t think they&#39;d be very good at keeping all this a secret. They&#39;d have to tell all my teachers, and the school nurse, and somebody could find out, and then I&#39;d have to run off and join a freakshow or something.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;That&#39;s a good point,&quot; Pop says. &quot;People can be cruel. So what did you have in mind instead?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; you say, trying to pin down your thoughts. &quot;Maybe we just don&#39;t tell them anything? Write me a note to get out of gym class, and maybe that&#39;s enough. By Monday I could be completely back to normal, don&#39;t you think?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Mom gives you a melancholy smile. &quot;We can always hope so.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;And if $nom[$oppgen] isn&#39;t?&quot; Pop asks bluntly.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;We could tell the school that $name is called, I don&#39;t know, &lt;&lt;if $startsex == &quot;female&quot;&gt;&gt;$fchoice&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;$mchoice&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; or something, a distant cousin who&#39;s staying with us,&quot; Mom suggests. &quot;We&#39;ll say the real $name has taken ill, and could they please send the homework home. Then you&#39;ll just do the work for both sets of classes.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Why both?&quot; you ask.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;In case it //doesn&#39;t// go back to normal,&quot; Mom says with a simple shrug. &quot;You still want to graduate high school, don&#39;t you?&quot; (&lt;&lt;link &quot;footnote 5&quot; &quot;1948 Footnotes&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;set $page to 5&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;/link&gt;&gt;)&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;And you&#39;ll pick up clothes tonight?&quot; Pop asks.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I made some calls,&quot; Mom promises. &quot;Some of the PTA mothers have some hand-me-downs we can have. If you take your car and I take mine, we&#39;ll cover a lot more ground. Do you mind?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;No, no,&quot; Pop says, pushing himself away from the table. &quot;Let&#39;s get going. $name, you should start getting ready for bed.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;elseif $path.includes(&quot;pussyboy schedule&quot;) or $path.includes(&quot;dickgirl schedule&quot;)&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;All right,&quot; Mom says, hanging up the phone with a clatter. &quot;It took a little convincing, but Mr Fordyce has agreed to let you attend school under your own name. I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s a good idea, myself, because I&#39;m //sure// those bullies at school are going to tease you when they find out about your ... your condition.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;What about clothes?&quot; Pop asks.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Oh, that&#39;s right,&quot; Mom says. &quot;I almost forgot. Mr Fordyce says you have to stick to the school dress code for $girlsboys[$gen]. If you switch back, then you stick to the dress code for $girlsboys[$oppgen] again. I&#39;ll write you a note to get you out of the regular gym class and into something else.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I can&#39;t just skip gym?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;No, it&#39;s required for all students, unless there&#39;s some reason they can&#39;t,&quot; Mom says.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;And you can,&quot; Pop says firmly. &quot;Look at you, you have two legs, two arms. There&#39;s got to be something you can do. I know guys who came back from the war who&#39;d //love// to have their arms and legs. You&#39;re not skipping gym, no sir.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;And I agree with your father,&quot; Mom says. &quot;All right, Earl, if you and I each take our cars, we&#39;ll be able to drive around and pick up some clothes. I made a few calls. Some of the mothers in the PTA have hand-me-downs we can have. $name, you&#39;d better start getting ready for bed.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;elseif $path.includes(&quot;secret girl schedule&quot;) or $path.includes(&quot;secret boy schedule&quot;)&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;All right, I think we&#39;re all settled,&quot; Mom says, hanging up the phone with a clatter. &quot;I didn&#39;t tell Mr Fordyce about your ... your condition. I just said you have to be excused from regular gym class for the rest of the year. They&#39;ll put you in an independent study program so you still get your exercise, but not with the other kids in your class.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Thanks, Mom.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;With a little bit of luck,&quot; Mom goes on, &quot;on Monday when we see Dr Bennett, he&#39;ll have a nice little remedy for you, and this will be all over soon.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I sure hope so.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Me too, honey. All right, it&#39;s been a long day. You&#39;d better start getting ready for bed.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;\
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;All right,&quot; you say, standing and picking up your plate.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Leave it,&quot; Mom tells you. &quot;You&#39;ve had quite a scare today. I&#39;ll make $sib help wash the dishes tonight. $sibnick!&quot; she calls toward the stairs. &quot;Yes, I hear you, eavesdropping. Not very clever, little missy. You get in here and start clearing the table. You&#39;ve got dishes to do.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;set $seeing to [3]&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;display &quot;CleanReturn&quot;&gt;&gt;

&lt;&lt;if $page == 13&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;if $path.includes(&quot;secret from scouts&quot;)&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;All right, then,&quot; Mom says, &quot;but when we talk to Dr Bennett on Monday, we&#39;re going to get a note or something. I don&#39;t like the idea of just hiding it from your scoutmaster. If you get caught, you could get kicked out of the scouts.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;That&#39;s something to mull over while &lt;&lt;if $startsex == &quot;male&quot;&gt;&gt;you&#39;re helping $sibnick do the dishes. You&#39;ve never had to do the dishes before; it always fell to your sister. Now that you&#39;re a girl, you suppose Mom thinks you ought to learn how. Are you going to have to learn how to be a Girl Scout now?&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;$sibnick is clearing the table by herself, and you&#39;re taking out the trash. Mom always made you girls do the dishes together. Now that you&#39;re a boy, $sib is doing them all by herself, and you&#39;re doing other chores. Dad figured it was time you started learning how. Are you going to have to learn how to be a Boy Scout, too?&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;elseif $path.includes(&quot;tell scouts&quot;)&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;You can call $scout after dinner,&quot; Mom decides. &quot;Eat up first, &lt;&lt;if $startsex == &quot;male&quot;&gt;&gt;help $sibnick with the dishes, and then you can make your call.&quot;&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;and you can make your call while $sibnick does the dishes.&quot;&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You try to explain the whole thing to $scout, but it&#39;s not easy over the phone. You get the distinct idea that $scout isn&#39;t really taking it all in.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Come to the meeting tomorrow and we can talk about it,&quot; $nom[$oppgen] says. &quot;We&#39;ll get it sorted out.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;That sounded a bit ominous. What happens if $scout decides you have to quit the scouts? Rules are rules, after all.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;elseif $path.includes(&quot;skip scouts&quot;)&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;You should call $scout after dinner and let $acc[$oppgen] know,&quot; Mom decides. &quot;Eat up first, &lt;&lt;if $startsex == &quot;male&quot;&gt;&gt;help $sibnick with the dishes, and then you can make your call.&quot;&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;and you can make your call while $sibnick does the dishes.&quot;&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You feel a bit guilty about having to lie to $scout, but there&#39;s nothing else you can do. Anyway, it&#39;s just one meeting.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;One meeting ... if Dr Bennett is able to give you a cure on Monday. That&#39;s a pretty big if.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;You&#39;re going to save her years of being picked on at school,&quot; you explain. &lt;&lt;if $newid == true&gt;&gt;&quot;Nobody&#39;s ragging me about it yet, but it&#39;s only a matter of time.&quot;&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;&quot;I feel like everybody&#39;s ragging me about this already.&quot;&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Neckties. &lt;&lt;if $path.includes(&quot;known zeta&quot;)&gt;&gt;We could tell the school in advance.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;We could set her up with a new name at a different school.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; We&#39;ve got time.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Don&#39;t drive her up the wall,&quot; you advise. &quot;We don&#39;t even know how it&#39;s going to affect //me// yet, not really.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I suppose you&#39;re right,&quot; Mom sighs. &quot;Inform her, but don&#39;t make it a burden. Your father might go along with that.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;

All right, let&#39;s see what I have that fits you. Irma,&quot; she says to the secretary, &quot;is there a faculty restroom we can use?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Yes, through that door,&quot; the secretary responds.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Mom pushes a bag of clothing into your arms. It&#39;s surprisingly heavy. &quot;Come on,&quot; she says briskly. &quot;I have to get home and start on the rolls.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You peek into the bag. Just as you suspected, &lt;&lt;if $startsex == &quot;male&quot;&gt;&gt;there are some dresses folded neatly on the bottom, with a couple pairs of girls&#39; shoes and some unfamiliar underwear on top. &quot;Girls&#39;&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;there are several pairs of slacks and shirts folded neatly on the bottom, with a couple pairs of boys&#39; shoes and some neckties on top. &quot;Boys&#39;&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; clothes?&quot; you ask. &quot;But I--&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;You&#39;re going to stick to the school dress code,&quot; Mom says. &quot;I tried to explain that you didn&#39;t want to, but the school was very firm on that subject. Now that I see you, I can see why. &lt;&lt;if $cupsize gt 1&gt;&gt;Your boobs are popping out of that shirt.&lt;&lt;elseif $strength gt 55&gt;&gt;Your muscles are going to pop the seams of that dress.&lt;&lt;elseif $hips gt 31&gt;&gt;Your hips are going to split the seam of those trousers.&lt;&lt;elseif $ht lt 168&gt;&gt;You&#39;re so short, that shirt looks like a tent on you.&lt;&lt;elseif $ht gt 175&gt;&gt;You&#39;re so tall, that dress looks like an apron on you.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;Those clothes don&#39;t fit you at all.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; I had to pick up some clothes and things for you at the thrift store. Otherwise, I would have been here a lot sooner.&lt;&lt;if $startsex == &quot;male&quot; and $hair gt 20&gt;&gt; And we just need to do something about that long hair of yours.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; Come on now, don&#39;t drag your feet, let&#39;s go.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;&lt;if $page == 19&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;if $startsex == &quot;female&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Thankfully, Mom doesn&#39;t follow you into the faculty bathroom. You duck inside and turn the lock on the heavy door.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Mom was right, you have to admit, when you look at yourself in the mirror. These clothes will never do. Reluctantly, you work on the buttons of your powder blue dress, and wrestle with the hooks on your bra. &lt;&lt;if $muscle gte 55&gt;&gt;All this extra muscle makes the band cut into your sides and makes the clasps difficult to undo.&lt;&lt;elseif $ht gt 172&gt;&gt;All this extra height makes your chest expand, and not in the usual ways. Your bra band cuts into your sides and makes the clasps difficult to undo.&lt;&lt;elseif $shoulders gt 36&gt;&gt;Your shoulders are bigger and broader, and your chest has expanded, so your bra band cuts into your sides and makes the clasps difficult to undo.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;You&#39;ve grown, and that makes the bra band much more snug, so that the clasps are difficult to undo.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;if $muscle gte 60&gt;&gt;In fact, you&#39;ve got muscles //everywhere// now. Your shoulders are huge, your arms are thick and powerful, and your chest ripples with strength.&lt;&lt;elseif $muscle gte 55&gt;&gt;In fact, you&#39;ve got muscles //everywhere// now. Your shoulders and arms are big and powerful, and your chest ripples with strength.&lt;&lt;elseif $muscle gte 52&gt;&gt;You&#39;ve got muscles now that you never had before.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;Your body is definitely a little thicker and stronger than it was before, you&#39;re sure of it.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; You&#39;re even starting to get hair on your chest, which looks flat and satisfyingly masculine somehow. A nice sleeveless white undershirt covers that up, and you pick out a white dress shirt that fits pretty well. The cuffs are nicely starched, and you feel much more presentable. You slip on a tie, and, remembering your knot-tying training from Girl Scouts, manage a nice Windsor knot on the third try.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Your mom bought you a couple pairs of trousers, and some fresh clean underwear -- new in the package, not from the thrift store. The underwear is surprisingly comfortable, much more to your liking than your old panties. There wasn&#39;t any room for your cock in those, but these are white and snug and spacious. &lt;&lt;if $cocksize gt 14&gt;&gt;And you need the room, too, because your dick takes up quite a bit of space down there.&lt;&lt;elseif $cocksize gt 12&gt;&gt;And you need the room, too. Your dick takes up a bit of space down there.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;And you need the room, too.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; The trousers fit nicely, too, although it feels a little strange to be wearing them at school. You were only ever allowed to wear dresses before. Trousers feel like a guilty pleasure. But why not? You&#39;re a boy now, after all. Your legs even //look// like boys&#39; legs do, all muscular and &lt;&lt;if $path.includes(&quot;shaved legs&quot;)&gt;&gt;hairy, even though you shaved recently.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;hairy.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; Add to that a pair of penny loafers, and your look is complete.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;All except the hair, that is, which goes down past your shoulders. That, and the shadow of stubble on your cheeks, gives you the look of a particularly well-dressed pirate. It&#39;s not an unhandsome look, but also not the kind of style that would pass the school dress code.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;&lt;set $path.push(&quot;buzzcut&quot;)&gt;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Predictably, Mom has an answer for that.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;When you emerge from the restroom in your new boyish attire, Mom is there with an electric hair clipper. She activates it with a buzz of oscillating blades. &quot;Turn around,&quot; Mom says imperiously. &quot;We&#39;re going to cut that down to size.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;She doesn&#39;t take no for an answer, and moments later she&#39;s buzzing around your ears with the clipper, shearing off all your carefully-cultivated locks and reducing your style to a simple tight buzz cut. It&#39;s very military.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Good,&quot; she says, holding your chin and turning your head side to side to get a better look. &quot;You still have makeup on. Better wash that off.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Okay.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I think you&#39;re done,&quot; she says. &quot;Better get back to class. We&#39;ll talk more tonight.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You look at the clock. It&#39;s nearly lunchtime. &quot;It&#39;s almost lunch.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Do that, then,&quot; she says. &quot;I&#39;m sure you can figure it out. You&#39;re a big boy now.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
--&lt;&lt;link &quot;go to lunch&quot; &quot;1948 Lunch&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;set $path.push(&quot;secret exposed&quot;)&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;/link&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;To your embarrassment, your mother joins you in the faculty restroom to help you get dressed. She hasn&#39;t done that since you were a little boy. &quot;You&#39;re going to need some help,&quot; she says. &quot;There&#39;s some bits in here that you probably aren&#39;t familiar with. At least I //hope// not,&quot; she adds archly, giving you the evil eye. &quot;That $so better not have shown you any tricks.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Mom takes a few moments to remove her topcoat and hang up her purse behind the door, and that gives you a chance to glance in the mirror to see what&#39;s become of you this time.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;The first thing you notice is your hair, &lt;&lt;if $hair gt 40&gt;&gt;which has exploded in length past your shoulders in long, cascading waves. You could feel it was //long// as it brushed your ears and tickled the back of your neck, but you had no idea.&lt;&lt;elseif $hair gt 30&gt;&gt;which has grown out just past your shoulders in long, silky waves. You could feel it was long by the way it brushed your ears and tickled the back of your neck, but not this long.&lt;&lt;elseif $hair gt 20&gt;&gt;which has grown down to your chin. You could feel that it was long by the way it tickled your ears, but not this long.&lt;&lt;elseif $hair gt 10&gt;&gt;which has grown out considerably into a shaggy mop of hair. It&#39;s not a boy&#39;s length any more. This is the kind of length that makes the principal cluck his tongue disapprovingly and pull out his ruler.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; Your face is &lt;&lt;if $fem gt 50&gt;&gt;much more feminine, softer and gentler, with fuller lips and a smaller chin. Your eyes seem larger and more open, and your brow has softened.&lt;&lt;elseif $fem gt 35&gt;&gt;a lot more feminine, softer and gentler, and you can tell your lips are fuller and your chin smaller.&lt;&lt;elseif $fem gt 20&gt;&gt;a bit more feminine, softer and gentler than before.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;a tiny bit more feminine, too, giving you a girlier look.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;The next thing you notice is your body. &lt;&lt;if $shoulders lte 32&gt;&gt;Your shoulders have become much narrower, and your frame is delicate and feminine.&lt;&lt;elseif $shoulders lte 33&gt;&gt;Your shoulders have become slightly narrower, giving you a more feminine frame.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;Your shoulders have started to narrow, giving you a more delicate-looking frame.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;if $strength lt 42&gt;&gt;Your muscles have evaporated, and your shoulders and arms have dwindled to slender stems.&lt;&lt;elseif $strength lt 44&gt;&gt;Your muscles have melted away, and your shoulders and arms have shrunk in size.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;Your muscles have started melting away, and your shoulders and arms are smaller now.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;if $cupsize == 5&gt;&gt;Your chest has popped out to a sizeable $cup[$cupsize], pushing out your pinstriped shirt with two big apple-sized scoops of female flesh, leaving you as large or slightly larger than most of the other girls in your year.&lt;&lt;elseif $cupsize == 4&gt;&gt;Your chest has swelled out to a respectable $cup[$cupsize], pushing out your pinstriped shirt with two big handfuls of female flesh, leaving you around the same size as most of the other girls in your year.&lt;&lt;elseif $cupsize == 3&gt;&gt;Your chest has grown out to a modest $cup[$cupsize], pushing out your pinstriped shirt with two small handfuls of female flesh, leaving you slightly smaller than most of the other girls in your year.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;Your chest has begun to grow out to a tiny $cup[$cupsize], nudging out the fabric of your pinstriped shirt.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; Your nipples poke out, large and prominent, and you can see the darker halo of your nipples right through your shirt.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Yes, that won&#39;t do,&quot; Mom says, noticing your shocked face in the mirror. &quot;Come on, get that shirt off. Let&#39;s see if one of these bras will fit you.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Mom manages to get one of the brassieres on you, but it&#39;s a bit of a struggle since you don&#39;t know what you&#39;re doing or how to help.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;if $cupsize gt 3&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Hmm,&quot; she says. &quot;Maybe. The band fits, but the cups aren&#39;t -- try smoothing it out. Grab the cup like this, and fit yourself into it.&quot; She demonstrates a pinching motion with one hand, and a kind of sweep with the other, and you manage to get your breast situated properly. &quot;Better. Now the other one. Yes, I think that&#39;ll do.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;She fishes in the bag for a suitable dress, and hauls out one in cotton-candy pink with white lace trim. &quot;I know, it&#39;s more of a party dress, but let&#39;s just see if it fits.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Mom makes you raise your arms so she can drop the dress over your head, and she spends a few minutes judiciously tugging at the fabric. &quot;It fits up top,&quot; she decides. &quot;Let&#39;s tie off the belt in a nice bow. Good! You just need some shoes and stockings to go with that, and you&#39;ll look great.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;&lt;set $path.push(&quot;cotton candy dress&quot;)&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;She fishes in the bag for a suitable dress, and hauls out one in cotton-candy pink with white lace trim. &quot;I know, it&#39;s more of a party dress, but let&#39;s just see if it fits.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Luckily, it doesn&#39;t -- Mom says you aren&#39;t big enough on top, and the dress looks too baggy on you. &quot;Let&#39;s try this one,&quot; she says, pulling out a pale yellow dress with blue flowers. &quot;This is a summer dress, so it might be a little chilly, but I didn&#39;t have much time to shop. Arms up.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;&lt;set $path.push(&quot;yellow sundress&quot;)&gt;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;This one fits to your mother&#39;s satisfaction, and she gets everything in place. &quot;There. It&#39;s not so bad with the belt tied, is it? Now you just need some shoes and stockings and you&#39;ll look great.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;\
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Grumbling, you take the pair of stockings from her and sit down on the lid of the toilet. Mom shows you how to roll them up into a little donut shape, then put your toes into the center so they roll up your legs easily. &lt;&lt;if $path.includes(&quot;shaved legs&quot;)&gt;&gt;&quot;These are nylons, so they&#39;re partially sheer. Thirty denier. That&#39;s what that number is right there on the packet. I figured you&#39;d shaved your legs, so you can get away with these, but be careful with them, because nylons are still expensive.&quot;&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;&quot;These are opaque white. Fifty denier. That&#39;s what that number is right there on the packet, see? I knew you hadn&#39;t shaved your legs, so this covers that up nicely. It&#39;s a little trick to remember.&quot;&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; After that, she tries a couple of pairs of shoes on your little feet. &quot;These will do,&quot; she decides, buckling on some black patent leather shoes and tucking the other pair back into the bag. &quot;Don&#39;t go getting them scuffed up, okay? They look much better polished like this.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You stand up and look at yourself in the mirror. &quot;Okay,&quot; you sigh. &quot;I guess that&#39;s good enough.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Oh, no it isn&#39;t,&quot; Mom says, unsnapping her purse. &quot;You&#39;re not going out there without any makeup on and embarrass me. Don&#39;t move, little lady, we&#39;ve got work to do still.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You have to hold still while Mom tends to your face. First the tweezers come out and stray hairs are plucked from your eyebrows, your nose, your cheeks, and your hairline. Then she sets to work applying all kinds of creams and powders to your face. Her description of each cosmetic is a blur of commentary that you can&#39;t keep up with: foundation, powder, rouge, eyeliner, lipstick, mascara, eyebrow pencil, concealer. After all that, &lt;&lt;if $hair gt 20&gt;&gt;she runs a comb through your hair several times to get the tangles out, and pulls your hair back into a metal clip to keep it out of your eyes.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;she runs a comb through your hair and bundles some of it into a metal clip to make it look more feminine.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;//Now// you&#39;re done,&quot; she says, looking you over critically and fluffing your hair. &quot;You&#39;d better get back to class.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You look at the clock. It&#39;s nearly lunchtime. &quot;It&#39;s almost lunch.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Do that, then,&quot; she says. &quot;I&#39;m sure you can figure it out. You&#39;re a big girl now.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Normally, yes, but there isn&#39;t time.&quot; Mom pulls out of the driveway and heads in the direction of downtown. &quot;We&#39;re going to stop by the thrift store to see if anybody has any second-hand uniforms that fit.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;The neighborhood Goodwill store is large and satisfyingly empty of people when you arrive, and the shelves are stuffed with donated merchandise. You remember it from years past as a bustle of activity, with crowds of shoppers picking over bare shelves, but perhaps that was just because of the Depression and the war years that followed. Your mother, never one to pass up a bargain, and not too proud to poke her nose in the door to find one, drags you straight for the children&#39;s clothing section, while you try to cover your face in case anybody is looking.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You suspect these shirts would still have been available at a more reasonable hour, but there&#39;s no point. Once Mom has convinced herself that she found a bargain, she&#39;ll twist an arm patting herself on the back for it.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;And trousers, too!&quot; she says, flipping through hanger after hanger of identical beige slacks. &quot;This one&#39;s frayed. No, this one has an ink stain on the pocket. Some boy tried to keep a pen in his pocket, no doubt. Oh, this one&#39;s good — a little long,&quot; she says thoughtfully, holding them up to your waist. &quot;I can take those in. Oh, and look, this one&#39;s very cheap. We should get both. You never know.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Do I have to wear a boy&#39;s uniform?&quot; you ask.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;There, you see?&quot; Mom says, plucking a few sea-green dresses from the rack and hanging them to one side. The skirts look awfully short to you. &quot;We did find a few that might fit. Good thing we came by early.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You suspect these dresses would still have been available at a more reasonable hour, but there&#39;s no point. Once Mom has convinced herself that she found a bargain, she&#39;ll twist an arm patting herself on the back for it.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;This one&#39;s nice,&quot; she says, flipping through hanger after hanger of identical dresses. &quot;This one&#39;s starting to fray at the pockets, do you see? This one&#39;s got the wrong button — I can fix that. Oh, that&#39;s too small for you,&quot; she says thoughtfully, holding it up against your body. &quot;Oh, but it&#39;s very cheap.

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;After an embarrassing half an hour at the Goodwill, you emerge with a new uniform tucked discreetly into a paper shopping bag. On the ride home, you find yourself sincerely hoping that nobody recognized you.&lt;/div&gt;

The attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941 interrupted a decades-long progressive education movement emphasizing science, engineering, and math, and which focused on critical analysis of American institutions. After Pearl Harbor, when fear and paranoia set in, such progressive notions were scrapped in favor of the &quot;lifestyle adjustment curriculum.&quot;

This was designed to teach life skills to the 60% of students who would not go on to post-secondary education. About 30% of students would graduate, and there were plenty of jobs available for this level of education. It proposed to teach American students to be good, patriotic (and pliable) citizens, claiming that the old progressive education taught children to be materialistic and gave them bankrupt morals. The &quot;lifestyle&quot; curriculum was criticized (at the time, and also later) for being too soft and non-academic, emphasizing daily life skills (like literacy) over rigorous study (like understanding and questioning what you read).

Part of the reason for this focus was a renewed interest in integrating American education with national defense priorities. While recruiting soldiers for World War II, the Army had to reject hundreds of thousands of applicants for being illiterate. They also discovered how disorganized and non-standardized the curriculum could be across various states; the quality of education varied widely. There was also a shortage of people skilled in modern foreign languages.

Homework was fairly unknown, especially at lower age levels; most high school students had less than 2 hours per evening. When the Soviets launched Sputnik in 1957 it forced a massive re-think of education in America vis-a-vis national defense priorities, and the burden of nightly homework began to ramp skyward.

Courses: reading, grammar, written and mental arithmetic, social studies, science, family life, hygiene, health, religion, speech. Geography (maps), languages, gym, home economics, biology, shop (&quot;industrial arts&quot;). Photography.

There would also be an emphasis on geography (especially map familiarity). Biology and home ec courses would start to teach first aid and nursing. During the war, schools would hold drives for paper and scrap metal. Intra-varsity athletics were emphasized, along with calisthenics drills, to increase student health in the event of national need. Social Studies courses focused on problems that related directly to national welfare -- unlike before the war, when the courses focused on critical problems within the US. (Our player in 1948 would have seen both of these techniques.)

Note: up until 1970 or so, it was common for boys to swim naked in gym class; suits &quot;of the simplest type&quot; were mandatory for girls. This is a fascinating sidelight into education in the 1940s, so I&#39;ll use it.

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;You will select some suitable classmates,&quot; Mrs Hull says in that precise, mannered way of hers, &quot;and perform for the class a short scene from the play. Get out your pencils, and I will read you the list of approved scenes.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Everyone in the class dutifully copies down the list.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Each scene may be performed by only one group,&quot; Mrs Hull continues. &quot;That way, we will cover most of the important parts of the play. You may find that there are more parts for men than for women. If that is the case, and your group does not have enough boys, girls are permitted to read the boys&#39; parts, or boys to read girls&#39; parts, if it must come to that.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Around you, your classmates exchange embarrassed titters. Nobody wants to be //that// unfortunate soul, who has to read a part for the opposite sex. They have //no// idea what that would be really like, you decide.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Then, naturally, $eng has to go and announce your presence to the entire class, and your anonymity is gone forever.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I require your attention, class,&quot; $eng says coolly. &quot;Endeavor to calm yourselves.&quot; She adjusts her spectacles and peers at a note on her clipboard. &quot;I understand we have a student in our class who has come down with ... a peculiar condition. If you have not been assiduously following the news, you may be unaware of it, but we now have a student among us who is afflicted by it, so we must strive to treat the situation with grace.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;She gestures toward you. &quot;$name $lastname, as you can see, has contracted a condition that has caused $acc[$oppgen] to become a $girlboy[$soppgen]. It is a rare disease that is not yet fully understood, but it is not, as far as we know, contagious, so there is no imminent peril that any of //you// will contract it also.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;An interested murmur goes around the class as people inspect you carefully.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;You must understand that this is a medical syndrome,&quot; $eng continues in that cool, detached way of hers. &quot;This is neither $poss[$oppgen] fault, nor should we assume it is $poss[$oppgen] choice. The rest of us must therefore be as accommodating as we can. Meanwhile, $currname is expected to adhere to all the usual rules and dress codes as any other $girlboy[$gen] in the school. Is that clear?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Her look is so stern and unforgiving that it is a few moments before any student dares raise their hand. One girl says, &quot;Is $nom[$gen] going to be reading a boy&#39;s part or a girl&#39;s part?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;A $girlboy[$gen]&#39;s part, of course,&quot; $eng says, &quot;just the same as anyone else. Unless there are not enough $girlsboys[$oppgen] to go around. Now, in reference to your assignment: you will be forming reading groups on Friday, so start thinking about whom you would select to partner with...&quot; and she&#39;s off the subject of your strange transformation and onto ordinary class business.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I require your attention, class,&quot; $eng says coolly. &quot;Endeavor to calm yourselves.&quot; She adjusts her spectacles and peers at a note on her clipboard. &quot;We have a new student among us.

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Very well. I assume you do not object to taking $poss[$oppgen] homework to $acc[$oppgen].&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;No, ma&#39;am.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Good. You will find a copy of //As You Like It// on the table in the back of class. Please select one and return to your seat.

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;$eng takes roll, looking over all the students&#39; faces in their assigned seats and trying to recall each name. When she comes to you, she pauses before recalling your name.&lt;/div&gt;

Now: who can tell me the two main characters of Act One?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Orlando?&quot; asks Doris Thacker, a cute brunette in glasses.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Yes, Orlando is one,&quot; $eng replies. &quot;Orlando has been ill-treated at the hands of his cruel brother, Oliver, who has denied Orlando the education and privilege accorded to him by rank. Who is the other central character?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Oliver?&quot; guesses Harold Giles, one of the boys who is usually found on the baseball field.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;No, not Oliver. Alice, do you know?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Alice Whitfield puts her hand down, folding it in front of her. &quot;The other main character is Rosalind,&quot; she says. &quot;Rosalind and Orlando are the central romantic figures. They meet at first and fall in love, but then later on Rosalind is disguised as a boy.&quot; She looks a little smug. &quot;I did this play over the summer so I know it really well. I played Celia.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Very good, Alice,&quot; $eng says. &lt;&lt;if $openzeta == true&gt;&gt;&quot;You might notice that this particular play resonates with &lt;&lt;if $sex == &quot;male&quot;&gt;&gt;Mr&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;Miss&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; $lastname&#39;s situation, where a female character is disguised as a male character.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;&quot;You may find it unusual that the author chose to have a female character disguised as a male character.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; This was actually a common element of Shakespeare&#39;s plays, because ... why? Does anyone know?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Because all the parts were played by men,&quot; Alice reports confidently.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Correct. Now, let us break down the first scene...&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;And $eng spends the rest of the class discussing how Orlando ran away to the Forest of Arden to get away from it all. You know how he must have felt.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;display &quot;NextClassLink&quot;&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;\
&lt;&lt;if $day == 4&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Today is the day $eng expects you to form groups for //As You Like It// and prepare to read a scene in front of the class. The students mill around, forming into little knots, trying to decide who to team up with. The calculations are swift and merciless: who&#39;s cool enough to be seen with? who&#39;s going to do the work and not drag everyone&#39;s grade down? are the cute ones already taken?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You and Doris Thacker quickly end up as a pair, because you sit right next to one another. She&#39;s a cute brunette &lt;&lt;if ($openzeta == true and $sex == &quot;female&quot;) or ($newid == true and $sex == &quot;male&quot;)&gt;&gt;who recognized you from your first day as a girl in Home Ec.&lt;&lt;elseif ($openzeta == true and $sex == &quot;male&quot;) or ($secret == true and $sex == &quot;female&quot;)&gt;&gt;who remembers you from the first day in Home Ec.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;who seems nice enough.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; There are a couple of other pairs who are looking to form a group of four, so you have to decide who to team up with.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;There&#39;s Ray Barnes, a scruffy-looking lad with an uneven collar and untucked-in shirt, paired up with Harold Giles, the second baseman on the school baseball team. &lt;&lt;if $openzeta == true&gt;&gt;Ray doesn&#39;t seem to like you much, and had apparently been making jokes about you to Harold, because Harold looks uncomfortable at the idea of teaming up with you.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;Ray seems to have a bad attitude toward class in general, while Harold just looks uncomfortable.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;The other pair is Arlene Stewart and Alice Whitfield. You remember Alice as an amateur drama enthusiast, who positively gushes about Shakespeare. You remember Arlene &lt;&lt;if $startsex == &quot;female&quot;&gt;&gt;from previous years as a judgmental princess who only seems to have gotten worse over the summer.&lt;&lt;elseif $openzeta == true&gt;&gt;as a haughty, condescending young woman who commented on your unshaved legs in gym class.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;from previous years as someone with a confident, superior attitude that never liked you very much.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Pick us,&quot; Ray demands. &quot;There&#39;s no good scenes with only two people. Either you get all the lines or you don&#39;t say nothin&#39; at all. And I ain&#39;t reading no girl parts or love scenes.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;The other boy laughs. &quot;Sure you do. I&#39;ve seen you go skinny-dipping before.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Besides, you know those swimsuits aren&#39;t hygenic,&quot; another boy points out. &quot;You wear clothes, you&#39;ll get the pool all dirty.

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;My brother says four weeks of swimming,&quot; says another girl. She&#39;s Irene Murphy. She and her brother are in the school choir.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Oh no!&quot; Arelene says, turning ashen.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;What&#39;s wrong with swimming?&quot; asks Irene.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;You&#39;re a freshman. You wouldn&#39;t //know,//&quot; Arlene sniffs. It&#39;s those horrible old school swimsuits.

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I like swimming,&quot; says Florence Foster. Everybody say she&#39;s the girl with the biggest tits in tenth grade, maybe in the whole school.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Well, you would,&quot; says skinny Arlene. &quot;//You// float.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;\
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;//Ugh. Swimming.// You hope against hope that you don&#39;t have to, but it turns out your worst nightmare has come true. $thisgym is going to make everybody swim.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Fortunately, that day will not be today. &quot;There&#39;s no need to dress for class today. Before we do any exercises, we&#39;ve got to get everybody measured and weighed in,&quot; $thisgym announces. &quot;It&#39;s important to have a way to measure physical fitness, so we can see if you are improving your bodies and your health.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Throughout the class, &lt;&lt;if $startsex == &quot;male&quot;&gt;&gt;$thisgym talks endlessly about the need for good, solid young bodies who are ready to fight for their country at a moment&#39;s notice. He doesn&#39;t let up for a minute, often booming in some poor boy&#39;s ear as he addresses the rest of the class.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;$thisgym goes on and on about how young ladies these days have to stay in shape if they expect to catch a husband. It&#39;s an endless refrain. She often calls out specific girls who are a little under- or overweight, making loud suggestions on calisthenics and stretches the girl should start doing, and different foods she should be eating.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Luckily, measuring everybody up takes most of the whole class. &lt;&lt;if $startsex == &quot;male&quot;&gt;&gt;The gym instructor gives you a strange look when he notes your height, but he doesn&#39;t take any other awkward measurements of your strangely altered body, so that&#39;s good.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;The gym instructor nods approvingly when she takes down your height, commenting you appear to have grown another inch over the summer. She does give you a strange look when taking measurements of your waist, shoulders, and hips, but instead of barking at you, she just purses her lips and says, &quot;Well, you&#39;ll develop soon enough.&quot;&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Still, you&#39;re going to have to do something about this whole swimming thing. Is there any way you can get out of it?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;if $startsex == &quot;male&quot;&gt;&gt;--&lt;&lt;link &quot;go to History&quot; &quot;1948 History&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;/link&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;--&lt;&lt;link &quot;go to Vocal Music&quot; &quot;1948 Vocal Music&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;/link&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;

&lt;&lt;if $day == 3&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;if $newid == true&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;There&#39;s no big announcement about your first day as a new student. Evidently $thisgym doesn&#39;t care for such formalities, or maybe $nom[$gen] figures the $girlsboys[$gen] will make friends naturally during classtime. That&#39;s a bit of a relief, because you already feel awkward sitting on a hard bench in the $girlsboys[$gen] locker room, looking around at the &lt;&lt;if $sex == &quot;female&quot;&gt;&gt;pink&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;blue&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; and green tiles and thinking, //Holy smokes, there&#39;s no $girlsboys[$oppgen] here at all. Not even me.//&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;It turns out that the boys&#39; and the girls&#39; gym classes are on exactly the same track: swimming for the first four weeks, like it or not. You may have a new gym teacher, $thisgym instead of $othergym, but the routine is the same. Almost the same, that is.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;if $sex == &quot;male&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;set $mact.push(&quot;workout&quot;)&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;set $mstrengthbonus += 3&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;set $shoulderbonus += 1&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;set $newknowns to [34, 24]&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;set $mact.push(&quot;workout&quot;)&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;display &quot;NewKnowns&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;We have to swim //naked?//&quot; you ask the boy next to you. &quot;They don&#39;t give us any swimsuits or anything?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Unhygenic, I guess,&quot; he says. &quot;Hang on, you mean they give suits to the girls?&quot; (&lt;&lt;link &quot;footnote 2&quot; &quot;1948 Footnotes&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;set $page to 2&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;/link&gt;&gt;)&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Didn&#39;t you know?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;No.&quot; A look of suspicion comes over his face. &quot;Wait, how did //you// know?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Me? What? Oh -- I have a sister,&quot; you say lamely.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Oh,&quot; he says, his face falling. &quot;I thought you peeked in the girls&#39; locker room or something, or into the pool while they were all swimming. I&#39;m Joe Turner, by the way.&quot; He offers his hand.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You stare at his hand for a moment, before remembering you&#39;re supposed to shake it. &quot;$currname $lastname.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;$thisgym waits until all the boys have undressed. You&#39;ve never seen so many naked boys in your life, not ever. Not even at the lake, where skinny-dipping is fairly common.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;//And I&#39;m one of them,// you realize. You&#39;re standing there in the locker room with your cock hanging out. Nobody seems to notice anything unusual about that. Nobody even glances your way.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;All right, line up,&quot; $thisgym barks. &quot;First thing on the list is pool hygiene. Before you get in the pool you&#39;re going to march through the showers. It goes hot water, cold water, hot, cold, and so on. When you get to the other side, go and get in the shallow end and we&#39;ll go over pool safety rules. You should be able to get in a good half hour of swimming today.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I know, they&#39;re //awful,// aren&#39;t they?&quot; the girl whispers back. &quot;They don&#39;t cover up //anything.// They&#39;re so thin. But I guess it&#39;s not hygenic to wear //too// much, so...&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;The boys don&#39;t wear anything at all,&quot; you murmur to her. (&lt;&lt;link &quot;footnote 2&quot; &quot;1948 Footnotes&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;set $page to 2&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;/link&gt;&gt;)&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Really? Nothing at all? Cross your heart?&quot; Her eyes are bright and excited. &quot;How do you know? Did you peek?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Er, I have a cousin,&quot; you explain.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Oh, phooey,&quot; she says, crestfallen. &quot;I thought you had some secret peephole or something. By the way, I&#39;m Florence Foster.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You know who she is -- the girl that everybody says has the biggest tits in tenth grade, maybe the whole school. You remember her from last period&#39;s Steno class, in fact. But you&#39;re pretending to be a new student. &quot;$currname $lastname,&quot; you say, offering a hand. She stares at it for a moment in confusion, then shakes it.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;$thisgym passes out school-issued swimsuits to each girl and waits while all the students get changed. You feel horribly exposed as you strip down, and grateful to be able to climb into the flimsy protection of the one-piece swimsuit. The material is thin and worn and the style is not flattering; it&#39;s a sleeveless design that comes down to the top of your thigh and all the way up to your neck.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You stand there with all the other girls, shivering in your suit in the cool locker room.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Didn&#39;t have time to shave your legs?&quot; asks Arlene Stewart archly, eyeing the thin hair on your calves. There&#39;s a note of haughty judgment in her voice.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Leave her alone,&quot; Florence says.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Didn&#39;t she //know// we would be swimming today? They told us //yesterday.//&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;She&#39;s new. Aren&#39;t you?&quot; Florence asks, turning to you.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Um, yes,&quot; you stammer.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;And that was it. Nobody said a word about you standing in the middle of the girls&#39; locker room. Nobody said, &quot;What are you doing here?&quot; or &quot;Hey, $name, where&#39;s your dick?&quot; They just treated you like one of the girls.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;All right, line up,&quot; $thisgym barks. &quot;First thing on the list is pool hygiene. Before you get in the pool you&#39;re going to march through the showers. It goes hot water, cold water, hot, cold, and so on. When you get to the other side, go and get in the shallow end and we&#39;ll go over pool safety rules. You should be able to get in a good half hour of swimming today.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;\
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Ugh, four weeks of //this?//&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;display &quot;NextClassLink&quot;&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;elseif $oldid == true&gt;&gt;(This is technically impossible on Day 3. If this appears, it is an ERROR.)


&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;\
&lt;&lt;if $day == 4&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;There&#39;s more swimming on the docket today.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Changing in the locker room is a bit of a blur. You&#39;re still not used to the idea of being in the $girlsboys[$gen]&#39; locker room. Holy heck, you&#39;re not even used to seeing //yourself// like this. You mostly try to avert your eyes from all the naked $girlsboys[$gen] surrounding you and keep your mind on your own business. It&#39;s a little harder to keep your eyes averted as $thisgym marches everybody through the hot and cold showers.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Being in the pool isn&#39;t so bad. Hardly anyone can see anything of your body below the waterline, so it doesn&#39;t much matter. &lt;&lt;if $sex == &quot;female&quot;&gt;&gt;And you&#39;re not the only girl who doesn&#39;t want to get her hair wet -- you, of course, because you&#39;re wearing a wig, but the other girls because it&#39;s a hassle. That&#39;s where the swimming caps come in handy.&lt;&lt;set $fact.push(&quot;workout&quot;)&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;And it&#39;s not like the other boys are spending a lot of time looking, either. From the occasional glimpses you&#39;ve seen around the pool, you don&#39;t have anything to worry about, anyway. Your dick is about the same as everybody else&#39;s in the chilly water.&lt;&lt;set $mact.push(&quot;workout&quot;)&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;set $mstrengthbonus += 3&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;set $shoulderbonus += 1&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Finally, Gym is over, and you can move on to your next class.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;&lt;if $day == 8&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;if $newid == true&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You&#39;re back in the $girlsboys[$gen]&#39; locker room, &lt;&lt;if $path.includes(&quot;art room makeout&quot;)&gt;&gt;after that unexpected little transformation in the Art Room today.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;after that unexpected transformation this morning.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; Just for a brief, shining moment, you had thought you put this all behind you. Now you&#39;re back.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;It&#39;s awful, that&#39;s what it is. &lt;&lt;if $sex == &quot;male&quot;&gt;&gt;$mgym isn&#39;t as nice as $fgem, the locker room doesn&#39;t smell as nice, and you don&#39;t get to wear anything in the pool.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;$fgym isn&#39;t as nice as $mgym, the girls in the locker room are meaner, and you have to wear those horrible suits.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;But it&#39;s hard to shake the feeling that you //belong// here. After all, this is where your gym class meets now. Right?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;elseif $oldid == true&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Being back in your old Gym class is a bit of a relief, even if you&#39;re still stuck doing swimming for another three weeks. Sure, &lt;&lt;if $sex == &quot;male&quot;&gt;&gt;$mgym isn&#39;t as nice as $fgem, the locker room doesn&#39;t smell as nice, and you don&#39;t get to wear anything in the pool,&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;$fgym isn&#39;t as nice as $mgym, the girls in the locker room are meaner, and you have to wear those horrible suits,&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; but at least it&#39;s familiar.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;It&#39;s still hard to shake the feeling for the first ten minutes that you&#39;re an impostor here. But that&#39;s not right, is it? This is the side of the locker rooms you //belong// on. Right?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;\
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;$thisgym blows $poss[$gen] whistle. &quot;All right, $girlsboys[$gen],&quot; $nom[$gen] shouts. &quot;Everybody through the showers! Remember, the breaststroke is tricky to learn, so you&#39;re going to want as much class time as possible working on your technique!&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Of course, the word //breaststroke// just makes the $girlsboys[$gen] in the class giggle like maniacs, but it doesn&#39;t strike you as funny right now.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;display &quot;NextClassLink&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;if $sex == &quot;male&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;set $mact.push(&quot;workout&quot;)&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;set $mstrengthbonus += 3&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;set $shoulderbonus += 1&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;\
&lt;&lt;if $day == 9&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You&#39;ve had a week of swimming, and you&#39;re starting to get back in the habit. &lt;&lt;if $sex == $startsex&gt;&gt;You can even tell your form is improving, although $thisgym doesn&#39;t remember seeing it. You&#39;ve had a lot of missed days as a $girlboy[$gen].&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;$thisgym says your form is improving, too, and that&#39;s always nice to hear.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;However, there was one brief and terrifying moment when you almost went into the wrong locker room after swimming. //Come on, $appname, focus!// you tell yourself.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;if $sex == &quot;female&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;When you return to the locker room, you find some of the girls are reading copies of the school newspaper. &lt;&lt;if $path.includes(&quot;open school interview&quot;) or $path.includes(&quot;anonymous school interview&quot;)&gt;&gt;You grab a copy off the stack by the coach&#39;s office door, reminding yourself to look for your interview.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;You consider getting a copy off the stack by the coach&#39;s door, but your hands are all wet, and you&#39;re sure the cheap newsprint would fall apart. Maybe later.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;\
&lt;&lt;display &quot;NextClassLink&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;if $sex == &quot;male&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;set $mact.push(&quot;workout&quot;)&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;set $mstrengthbonus += 3&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;set $shoulderbonus += 1&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;\
&lt;&lt;if $day == 10&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Midway through learning about the backstroke, $thisgym announces that next Friday there will be an important quiz. &quot;It&#39;s all about water safety,&quot; $nom[$gen] says. &quot;Starting on Monday we will be going over the Silvester method for artificial respiration. We will be going over the Holger-Nielsen method. We will be going over the use of lifesavers //are you paying attention, &lt;&lt;if $sex == &quot;female&quot;&gt;&gt;Miss Murphy? I thought so.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;Turner? Eyes front.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;// These are things that can save your life, or save the life of another, if you find yourself going into the water.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Still, there&#39;s enough time left in class to get good and tired of doing the backstroke. At least with your head half-submerged, you don&#39;t have to hear anybody talking about Dimorphic Zeta Chromosome Syndrome.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;display &quot;NextClassLink&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;if $sex == &quot;male&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;set $mact.push(&quot;workout&quot;)&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;set $mstrengthbonus += 3&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;set $shoulderbonus += 1&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;

&lt;&lt;if $day == 11&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;if $path.includes(&quot;emergency TG&quot;)&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You get a distinct sense of //deja vu// as you return to the swimming pool, this time dressed as a $girlboy[$gen].&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;It&#39;s diving lessons. You are hardly surprised.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;$thisgym lines everybody up by the diving board. You yawn.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;A couple of the girls in the class give you strange looks, as if they can&#39;t figure out how come you&#39;ve developed so suddenly over the past week. You smile at them and wave back -- you&#39;re not about to tell them your secret.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;display &quot;NextClassLink&quot;&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;elseif $path.includes(&quot;SO emergency date&quot;) or $path.includes(&quot;friend emergency date&quot;)&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You can&#39;t stop thinking about stolen kisses in the hallway.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Gym class starts with a brief introduction to diving safety: how to enter the water, how to come back up, how to keep water out of your nose. $thisgym lines everybody up at the diving board and settles in to a lifeguard&#39;s chair to evaluate your form.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Still, you can&#39;t clear your head. You have kisses on the brain. And you can feel your body start to warm up. Even though you&#39;re standing &lt;&lt;if $sex == &quot;male&quot;&gt;&gt;naked&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;in a flimsy see-through swimsuit&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; in a chilly indoor swimming area, you still feel like someone has built a glorious fire inside you.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;//Oh jeez, not here!// you think. //If I transform here, right now...//&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Desperately, you wave to the gym teacher. &quot;Sick,&quot; you blurt out, holding your stomach. &quot;Gotta go to the nurse.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;$thisgym glowers at you, but points toward the exit. &quot;Go! Don&#39;t you do anything in my pool.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You rush for the safety of the locker room, bare feet slapping on the wet tiles.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;The heat keeps generating inside of you, and you can&#39;t make it subside. You feel like your body is blazing, and your head seems to be cracking in half.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;No no no,&quot; you chatter to yourself, bent double in front of your locker. //Gotta get dressed. Can&#39;t change yet.//&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;But you //are// changing, and you have to get somewhere safe. You grab your lumped-up clothes out of your locker. Maybe you could get as far as the bathroom area and lock yourself into one of the stalls.&lt;/div&gt;
--&lt;&lt;link &quot;run to the bathroom&quot; &quot;1948 Solo&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;set $page to 11&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;/link&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;display &quot;SexSwitch&quot;&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Today, the class begins a course on diving safety. This means a lot of standing around &lt;&lt;if $sex == &quot;male&quot;&gt;&gt;naked,&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;in those flimsy, see-through suits,&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; waiting in line for the diving board, while the gym teacher evaluates everyone&#39;s form.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You&#39;re not sure what the point is. Of all the valuable things you //could// be learning about right now — like how to cure a mysterious virus so your life isn&#39;t turned upside down — you don&#39;t imagine that diving would rank very high on any list. At least, no list that you can think of.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;We have new textbooks this year,&quot; $hist announces. He&#39;s a rumpled-looking man with a brown blazer that has patches on the elbows. &quot;We want to make sure all of our students have a firm grounding in American history, and that we all understand what a unique and special country this is.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;It strikes you as a little strange. You remember your teachers in previous history classes weren&#39;t afraid to criticize social issues in America. This textbook seems filled with nothing but abject praise for everything about America, and no mention of any issues or problems that might need improvement. (&lt;&lt;link &quot;footnote 4&quot; &quot;1948 Footnotes&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;set $page to 4&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;/link&gt;&gt;)&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;$hist&#39;s reasoning soon becomes clear. &quot;The government wants to make certain that we all know what it takes to be good citizens, in light of the Communist threat which stretches around the world,&quot; he says. &quot;That means Congress is taking a much greater interest in any possible Communist threats to our way of life, including how we teach subjects like this one. We can&#39;t be too careful. Now, this might be a little different from history classes you have taken in the past--&quot; he coughs nervously-- &quot;but if any of you has any questions, feel free to see me after class.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;At least nobody says anything about the way you look.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;For the remainder of class, $hist delivers a lecture covering a thousand years of history covering the whole of Egypt, and then has the class answer questions at the end of the chapter. &quot;We&#39;re only covering Egypt and the Arab lands during this first week,&quot; he says. &quot;Next week we&#39;ll move on to the Greeks and Romans, if we get to it.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You look down at your notes. The flooding of the Nile, pharaohs, gods. Agriculture. Geometry. Building. And lots of personal opinions given by $hist about how much better America does these things, thanks to the early efforts of faraway people. It&#39;s a bit of a one-sided look, if you&#39;re being honest with yourself. It&#39;s a very //American// perspective.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;&lt;elseif $oldid == true&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;$hist launches into a new lecture about the Greeks today, covering so many topics in the hour that it makes your head spin.

The Roman kingdom — no, the Roman Republic — wait, now it&#39;s an Empire. All these terms float past you: tribunes, consuls, dictators, senators.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You copy everything down like mad, hoping that it&#39;ll make sense later when you do your reading.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;The only respite from the lecture is when two students from the Journalism department drop off a stack of freshly-printed school newspapers in the back of the room. &lt;&lt;if $path.includes(&quot;open school interview&quot;) or $path.includes(&quot;anonymous school interview&quot;)&gt;&gt;You make a note to pick one up on your way to Vocal Music.

Cross your legs at the knee, and place your steno pad, thus. Now your hand is in the proper position to write, but your view of the proceedings is unobstructed. Try it.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You and the girls attempt to mimic $steno&#39;s posture, placing your writing pads properly and holding the pencil poised just so. &lt;&lt;if $sex == &quot;male&quot;&gt;&gt;Your balls feel crushed between your legs, and your hips feel a little stiff, but you manage to approximate the correst posture.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;You feel a little strange with your legs crossed, because it&#39;s so //easy.// There&#39;s nothing in the way. And your hips are wider, and your thighs thinner, so you get a better angle. It&#39;s actually quite comfortable.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Very good, girls,&quot; she says to all of you, moving around the room. &quot;Miss Morris, straighten your skirt, it&#39;s bunched up. Excellent form, Miss Watson. Miss Foster, don&#39;t hunch over, it&#39;s unladylike.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;But I can&#39;t see the page,&quot; says one young woman. She doesn&#39;t say it, but everybody is thinking it: her boobs are in the way.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;You don&#39;t need to see the page, Miss Foster,&quot; $steno says. &quot;That is the whole point of stenography. You watch what is happening, and feel your way across the page with your hand. Even if a lady has a larger chest than other girls, that shouldn&#39;t be any kind of hindrance at all. There! You look like a perfect little steno pool. Let&#39;s begin with the first letters of the alphabet: S, F and V. In shorthand, these look very similar to one another.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;She proceeds to demonstrate the shorthand for safe, face, save, faces, and saves on the chalkboard. They look almost exactly the same.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;//Just like me,// you think. //Almost exactly the same, but not quite.//&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;&lt;if $day == 4&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;All throughout Stenography class, $steno drones on and on about the phonetic spelling of words with your whole //seven// letters — S, F, V, A, E, N, and M. You start to lose track of the different squiggles. Straight lines, long lines, shorter lines, vertical, horizontal. Big loops, smaller loops. It&#39;s all a mess on the chalkboard.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You listen &lt;&lt;if $secret == true and $sex == &quot;male&quot;&gt;&gt;alertly for any signs that people are talking about you, but you hear nothing.&lt;&lt;elseif $path.includes(&quot;SO date&quot;) and $sex == &quot;female&quot;&gt;&gt;with one ear, thinking of your date with $so tonight. What will you wear? Will $so still want to make out with you? //Will it work?//&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;with one ear, writing hurtful comments about $steno&#39;s unstylish dress on the edge of your note paper.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;&lt;if $day == 8&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;The first thing $steno says to the class is that there will be a surprise quiz sometime during the week.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Jean Morris raises her hand and asks, &quot;But then it isn&#39;t a surprise.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;$steno contemplates this for a moment, then says, &quot;Would you rather I did not announce them?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I just wondered why you were calling it a //surprise,//&quot; Jean said. &quot;If you tell us about it, it&#39;s not.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Shut up, shut up,&quot; whispers Florence Foster under her breath.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;if $openzeta == true or $newid == true or $secret == true&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;The quiz will be dictation practice on the letters you have already learned, which still aren&#39;t very solid in your mind. They&#39;re all just basic squiggles to you. A bit more practice wouldn&#39;t hurt.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;elseif $oldid == true&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;The quiz will be dictation practice on all the letters you are supposed to have learned since last Tuesday. In actuality, you haven&#39;t been in Stenography class since Wednesday, and although you&#39;ve been doing the reading at home, it&#39;s not the same as getting hands-on practice. Better hit the books a little harder.&lt;/div&gt;

Spelling in the Gregg shorthand system is mostly by //sound,// not by the usual rules of spelling.&quot; She allows herself a simpering half-smile. &quot;I admit when I first learned shorthand, I was unable to spell worth beans. My English teacher was so vexed with me.&quot; She turns to the chalkboard, chalk in hand. &quot;Now write it with me: the E group. //Bit, bet,// and //beet.// If you&#39;re not careful, they will start to look very similar and you won&#39;t be able to tell them apart.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;After a few moments, she returns to the classroom and begins to lecture on the next letters you&#39;re going to learn. The air is filled with her droning, sleep-inducing voice, but this time you&#39;re not lulled by it.

At the lowest part of the room is the conductor&#39;s pit, where there is an old Wurlizter piano and a lectern. The chalkboards have been painted with blank musical staves.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Your teacher for Vocal Music is $music, the same instructor you had last year for 9th grade, and the year before that in junior high school.

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;This year, she seems a little calmer. &quot;I&#39;m so glad to see so many of your lovely faces again this year,&quot; she says warmly. &quot;If any of you has a younger brother or sister, you might have heard that the school district has finally hired another music teacher for elementary and junior high, which will leave me more time for all of my high school students.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You remember the teacher shortages of 1946. After the war, there just weren&#39;t enough teachers to go around.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Oh, that&#39;s great!&quot; says Henry Murphy, and his sister Irene agrees. &quot;Congratulations, $music.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Thank you, Henry. The first thing we&#39;re going to do is sing the national anthem, and then the school song,&quot; she says. &quot;I&#39;ll go around the room as you&#39;re singing and listen to your voices, because I think some of them might still be changing. Then I can separate you into your proper registers.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Nervously, you seek out $fr and try to stand next to $acc[$oppgen], just in case. $fr gives you a look. You lean over and whisper, &quot;Meet me at lunch?&quot; and $fr nods back.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You can hear the whispering: there&#39;s a committee forming for the Homecoming dance; the football team is playing its first game in a week; Miss Lester, the science teacher, is getting married; the girls&#39; toilet on the south side of the school is being fixed, and someone thought they heard someone mention that the janitor it was because of too many cigarette butts. &lt;&lt;if $openzeta == true&gt;&gt;And there are some whispers about //you.//&lt;&lt;elseif $path.includes(&quot;known zeta&quot;)&gt;&gt;And there are some whispers about a special student in the school who is sometimes a girl and sometimes a boy, and you wonder if someone in the principal&#39;s office ratted you out.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;Then you hear someone whisper about a special student in the school who is sometimes a girl and sometimes a boy, and you start to get a sick feeling in your stomach.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;$music&#39;s ears were better than her eyes. &quot;Newspapers away, I said, I can hear the pages rustling,&quot; she announces without missing a beat on the piano. &quot;And that should have been an F sharp, Miss Lewis, not an F natural.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;$fr nudges you. &quot;Did you hear that?&quot; $nom[$fgen] whispers.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Yes, of course.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Have you read the article yet?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;No, I haven&#39;t had time.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I have a copy,&quot; $fr says. &quot;Let&#39;s check it out at lunchtime.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Sure, okay.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Not in the cafeteria, though,&quot; $fr warns. &quot;Let&#39;s go behind that building where the pool is. Over by the back doors of the gym.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&lt;&lt;if $bent == &quot;forthright&quot;&gt;&gt;&quot;Why so secret?&quot;&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;&quot;Why there?&quot;&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&lt;&lt;if $path.includes(&quot;open school interview&quot;) or $path.includes(&quot;anonymous school interview&quot;)&gt;&gt;&quot;I want to talk about the article, and if everybody sees you in the cafeteria, they&#39;ll crowd around.&quot;&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;&quot;I want to talk about the article without anybody listening. Maybe somebody found out about you.&quot;&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;&lt;if $day == 10&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Nobody brings up the article in //The Aerie// today, at least not out loud. But you can still hear the word //zeta// being whispered in the ranks. Someone in the bass section mentions the word a couple of times, pointing over toward the sopranos. In between songs, you can see someone re-reading the article, with her friend looking over one shoulder.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Maybe you&#39;ll get lucky, and everyone will be tired of the news before next week&#39;s newspaper rolls out.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Yes,&quot; you admit. &quot;Not too long ago.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Jane and Irene Murphy come over to check out your changes. &lt;&lt;if $sex == &quot;male&quot;&gt;&gt;&quot;You look good,&quot; Jane says, looking you over. &quot;I like your tie.

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;That was close,&quot; $fr murmurs to you as $span walks away.&lt;/div&gt;

Please make &lt;&lt;if $sex == &quot;female&quot;&gt;&gt;Señorita $lastname&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;Señor $lastname&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; feel welcome. However, I do not wish to take up valuable class time, so please find your partner from yesterday and review your greetings and introductions. $currname, you may partner with $fr, because $name does not appear to be here today.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;\
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You huddle with $fr again, finding a quiet corner of the class where you won&#39;t be overheard. Keeping an eye on $span, who is roving around the room listening to students practice, you murmur to $fr, &quot;It&#39;s still going on. You know, the ... the thing.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;$fr nods at you. &quot;You know, I&#39;ve been thinking,&quot; $nom[$fgen] says. &quot;You said you were necking with $so the night before? And you had a ... a night dream about S-E-X?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;It didn&#39;t go that far,&quot; you whisper.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Then maybe what you have to do is repeat the experiment,&quot; $fr says. &quot;Do it again. Invite $so over and make out. See what happens.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&lt;&lt;if $sex == &quot;female&quot;&gt;&gt;&quot;But $so and I have made out loads of times before.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;&quot;But $so and I have made out before. I mean, not //loads// of times, but we&#39;re not //brand new// at it.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; And I&#39;ve had dreams like that before and nothing like this ever happened.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Maybe not,&quot; $fr says. &quot;But in my Biology class--&quot; $nomcap[$fgen] breaks off suddenly and switches to Spanish as $span wanders by, listening. When she&#39;s gone, $fr leans in again. &quot;It got me thinking. Maybe this is a stage of development or something. This didn&#39;t happen before because you weren&#39;t //ready.//&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I&#39;m not ready //now,//&quot; you point out. &quot;Besides, this is just some temporary disease. I must have caught it somewhere.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;There&#39;s one way to test it,&quot; $fr says with a nervous smile. &quot;If you and I make out, maybe you&#39;ll have another dream and flip back to normal. If it doesn&#39;t work, then it&#39;s probably something you caught.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;But what if you catch it?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Oh, I don&#39;t think so,&quot; is $fr&#39;s breezy reply. &quot;Look at the facts. $so hasn&#39;t changed, right?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&lt;&lt;if $openzeta == true&gt;&gt;&quot;No, I saw $acc[$sogen] today.&quot;&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;&quot;No, not that I ever noticed.&quot;&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;There you go. You would have noticed. So that&#39;s all you have to do.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Look at you, you&#39;re a regular detective.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;$fr grins. &quot;Yes, we&#39;re a regular Nick and Nora Charles. Like from that movie, //The Thin Man.//&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Except &lt;&lt;if $sex == &quot;male&quot;&gt;&gt;you get to be Myrna Loy, and I&#39;m stuck being William Powell,&quot;&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;you get to be William Powell, and I&#39;m stuck being Myrna Loy,&quot;&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; you grumble.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Well, think about it,&quot; $fr urges you quietly. &quot;Let me know what you decide. We could try tomorrow night. My old man won&#39;t be home. Or maybe it should be you and $so, to really recreate the event.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I can&#39;t blame you!&quot; $fr looks sympathetic. &quot;I wouldn&#39;t want to hang around waiting either.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I was out sick that day,&quot; Glenn says.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;No, you weren&#39;t. You stole my hot dog.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;That was Gordon. I don&#39;t like ketchup on hot dogs.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Aha! How did you know I have ketchup on my hot dog, then?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Because you always do,&quot; Glenn says. &quot;So, is it true?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Yes, it&#39;s true,&quot; you admit.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You are gratified to see that most of the class aren&#39;t all that concerned about your condition. Somehow, you had expected much more drama and rejection. Your confession even draws some interested looks, and many more questions.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;if $startsex == $sex and $sex == &quot;male&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Do you really wear dresses?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Ha ha! What size //bra// do you wear, huh?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;You must have a //huge// closet!&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;elseif $startsex == $sex and $sex == &quot;female&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Do you really get to wear trousers to school?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Are the boys&#39; bathrooms really that dirty?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;You must have a //huge// closet!&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;elseif $startsex == &quot;female&quot; and $sex == &quot;male&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Are you really going to ask a girl to Homecoming?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Is it hard to shave your face?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Don&#39;t you miss all the pretty clothes? I know I would!&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;elseif $startsex == &quot;male&quot; and $sex == &quot;female&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Did a boy really ask you to Homecoming?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I wonder if he has to shave his legs like we do.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I bet you don&#39;t miss how long it takes to get ready! It takes me //forever.//&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;\
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Which do you like better?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Oh, //please,//&quot; Ray groans. &quot;Lay off. This kid&#39;s all wet. I know — $nom[$sgen]&#39;s in my English class. &lt;&lt;if $path.includes(&quot;Harold and Ray&quot;)&gt;&gt;We had to read stupid Shakespeare &lt;&lt;if $path.includes(&quot;Jaques&quot;)&gt;&gt;together today.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;together, and I had to pretend to flirt with $acc[$sgen], playing Rosalind.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;I had to watch $acc[$sgen] reading Shakespeare today, playing &lt;&lt;if $path.includes(&quot;Rosalind&quot;)&gt;&gt;Rosalind&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;Orlando&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; and trying to flirt with Arlene Stewart.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; It&#39;s no big deal.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;But the questions and the attentions don&#39;t stop.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Come on,&quot; you say. &quot;You&#39;re embarrassing me.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;//¡Atención, por favor!//&quot; says $span, finally interrupting the clamor. She had been watching with mild interest, evidently curious herself about your condition. &quot;You are embarrassed. //Dilo en español.//&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Uh,&quot; you say, &quot;//estoy &lt;&lt;if $sex == &quot;male&quot;&gt;&gt;avergonzada.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;avergonzado.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;&quot;//&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;$span half-smiles, amused. &quot;Close,&quot; she says. &quot;//¿Eres un niño o una niña?//&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Fiddlesticks!&quot; You sigh, as the class laughs. &quot;I did it again.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Class, be careful with your endings,&quot; $span says. Glancing your way, she adds, &quot;You, I think, more than anyone.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Who do you suppose it is?&quot; asks Glenn, one of the Baker twins. He is teamed up with Ray Barnes, and is practicing the new vocabulary: emotions. The example sentences are all about whether you find certain situations interesting, difficult, or boring, and so on.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I dunno,&quot; says Ray Barnes sourly. &quot;I bet you can tell, though. Just by looking at &#39;em.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Tell how?&quot; asks Glenn.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Like ... all their boy clothes are red, and all their girl clothes are blue, or somethin&#39;,&quot; says Ray with great confidence. &quot;Or it&#39;ll be some boy who does a lot of sports, an&#39; a girl who does a lot of, you know, girl things, like baking and such.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Why&#39;s that?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;To throw people off the scent,&quot; Ray declares. To you, he says, &quot;Hey, $currname, what do you reckon? Pretty nutty story, huh? Wouldn&#39;t you like to know who it is?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Sure, I&#39;m interested,&quot; you say.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;//Dilo en español, por favor,//&quot; says $span, passing by your group of tables.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Uh,&quot; you say. &quot;//Estoy &lt;&lt;if $sex == &quot;female&quot;&gt;&gt;interesado.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;interesada.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;//&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Yeah, interesting,&quot; Ray says, and turns back to his partner Glenn.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;$fr leans close. &quot;You said it wrong. You&#39;re &lt;&lt;if $sex == &quot;female&quot;&gt;&gt;a girl, so it should be //interesada//.&quot;&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;a boy, so it should be //interesado//.&quot;&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You sigh. &quot;Fiddlesticks. I did it again.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;&lt;if $day == 10&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Today is all about the difference between //ser// and //estar.// There are two forms of //to be// in Spanish, and they&#39;re used for very different things. Permanent conditions are states are used with //ser//, while temporary states, like emotions, are attached to //estar.//&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;In your personal practice duo with $fr, you get a chance to apply the different verbs in sentences.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;So would you say &lt;&lt;if $startsex == &quot;male&quot;&gt;&gt;//soy hombre,// or would you say //estoy hombre?//&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;//soy mujer,// or would you say //estoy mujer?//&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; Is it temporary or permanent?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Very funny,&quot; you mutter.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I was just trying to lighten the mood,&quot; $fr says.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Thanks, but it&#39;s not helping,&quot; you say. &quot;I&#39;ve got $bully breathing down my neck. I think $nom[$bgen]&#39;s serious about beating me up after school tomorrow. What am I supposed to do?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Tell the principal, maybe?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Then I&#39;ll just be chickening out.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Yes, and you won&#39;t get your &lt;&lt;if $bgen == 3&gt;&gt;face smashed in by that caveman,&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;hair pulled out by that witch,&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; either,&quot; $fr points out.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I can see the appeal, yes,&quot; you grin. &quot;But ratting $bully out to a teacher wouldn&#39;t make $acc[$bgen] stop ragging on me, would it? It&#39;d probably just make it worse. I&#39;d look like I have something to hide or be ashamed of.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;That&#39;s true.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I have to come up with //something.//&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;And it&#39;d better be by tomorrow,&quot; $fr warns.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;The door to the classroom opens, and one of the seniors comes in from the principal&#39;s office. She hands $span a note, and leaves.

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;What did I do?&quot; you ask, rising to your feet and collecting your things.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;It doesn&#39;t say,&quot; she says, turning the note over to look at the other aside. &quot;You&#39;ll just have to report down there and find out what Mr Fordyce wants.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Unfortunately, the instructor, $geom, is the same one you have for gym class. As if carrying on directly from his previous speech in the gymnasium, he goes on and on about how the Army needs good, brave men to step up and learn to become engineers and cartographers. &quot;Geometry is a useful skill,&quot; he tells the class. &quot;In this class, we will help you to read maps and triangulate distances, to find areas and make calculations for all kinds of construction, and we&#39;ll even do some experiments in the field. I have some lessons planned where you must follow directions on a map, and then calculate the distance to a hidden gun emplacement.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Some of the boys raise a cheer. $fr gives you an excited thumbs-up sign at the idea of traipsing around with a map and compass, but you just feel a little ill. Somehow, even mathematics has been turned into a boys-only club, and you&#39;re not quite sure whether you belong to that club any more.&lt;/div&gt;

He&#39;s the same instructor for boys&#39; gym class, apparently.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;He welcomes you to the class with obvious discomfort, and briefly explains your presence to the others. By this late in the day, the reaction is more subdued. You&#39;ve already had classes with some of these boys, and they already know the story. &quot;Miss $lastname will be joining us in Geometry for the duration,&quot; he says, &quot;owing to changes in her schedule. I have my doubts about whether geometry is an appropriate class for a young lady, but I&#39;m sure one of you boys will be able to assist her if she has difficulty.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You can&#39;t help but seethe a little at that. You&#39;re not an //idiot,// you&#39;re just a girl. Well ... not at the //moment//, but usually. Of all the reactions anyone could have to this strange week you&#39;ve been having, you didn&#39;t expect anyone to just //ignore// it all and pretend it wasn&#39;t happening.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Not only that, you can see $so on the other side of the classroom, wincing visibly as two other boys whisper in his ear. This has to be as hard on $so as it is on you.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;$geom barely makes mention of your arrival in his class except to comment &quot;new student&quot; after he reads your name from the roll list.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;It&#39;s nice to feel completely invisible again. $so gives you a small nod from across the room, and that&#39;s reassuring, too, even though he has no idea who you really are.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;elseif $secret == true&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;$geom starts off the class period by reading roll call. He announces your name with all the others, as if nothing has changed about you.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;&lt;set $newknowns to [17, 3, 4]&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;We are going to begin today with the principles of plane geometry as devised by the Greek mathematician Euclid, in the 4th century BC. Euclid gave us several axioms — who knows what an axiom is?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Harold Giles, the popular baseball player, raises his hand. &quot;Something that is always true.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Very close. It is //presumed// to be true,&quot; $geom corrects him. &quot;It cannot be proven, but its truth is self-evident. Geometry begins with several axioms -- fundamental definitions that form a foundation that everything else rests upon. Can anyone give an example of an axiom?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;East is east and west is west,&quot; offers Gerald Myers, grinning broadly.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;And never the twain shall meet,&quot; $geom says, finishing the Kipling quote. &quot;Very good. The logical principle of self-identity. Anyone else?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;One of the Baker twins raises his hand. &quot;Boys will be boys?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Yes, Glenn, although that&#39;s the //same// principle, stated a different way. Anyone else?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;//Except sometimes boys __aren&#39;t__ boys,// you think, copying down the word //axiom// and scowling at it.&lt;/div&gt;

Could this be the secret method for changing back to normal?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Besides, you&#39;re still thinking about what $fr suggested, about finding a way to turn back to normal.

&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;\
&lt;&lt;if $day == 8&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;A lot of you may be wondering,&quot; $geom says at the beginning of class, &quot;what use it is to study mathematics. You may think you&#39;ll never use these skills in real life. What difference does it make if you can find a congruent triangle, you might say. Or compute the Pythagorean theorem. Well, I&#39;ll tell you.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Learning do to math speedily and well is of vital importance in everyday life,&quot; he goes on expansively. &quot;From calculating the price of a new car, to adjusting the proportions of a chemical formula, to computing the amount of seeds you need for your lawn or garden, you need mathematics. How many people here have used tools around the house?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;A couple of hands go up, including yours.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;if $openzeta == true and $sex == &quot;female&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;$geom&#39;s eyes land on you, sitting there in your dress. &quot;You, uh, $name,&quot; he says, consulting his classroom seating chart. &quot;What kind of tools have you used at home? A mixer? An iron?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;No, I mean carpentry tools,&quot; you say indignantly. &quot;I&#39;m helping my old man build a fence out back. And I&#39;m going to get my Carpentry badge in scouts.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;The Girl Scouts?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;The //Boy// Scouts,&quot; you explain. &quot;I have this condition, remember?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;$geom&#39;s eyes land on you. &quot;$name,&quot; he says, without a glance at the seating chart. &quot;What kind of tools have you used at home? A saw? A hammer?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Sure,&quot; you nod. &quot;And my old man was going to show me how to use a chalk line this weekend. We&#39;re building a fence. And I&#39;m getting my Carpentry badge in scouts.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;\
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Ah, yes.&quot; His eyes go unfocused as he tries to recall, and he glances at his classroom seating chart again. &quot;Right. Well.&quot; A brief cough, and he moves on. &quot;Now&#39;s the time to show all of you the value of excellence. You&#39;ll notice I have rolled in another chalkboard in the back of the room. For the rest of the semester, students will be competing for the prize of //doing less homework.//&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;There is a buzz of interest at that.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Every column in the class is a team,&quot; he goes on, gesturing with a flat hand to show the line of desks before him. &quot;You will compete as a team. I will give you an easy problem to solve, and the boy who solves it gets a point for his &lt;&lt;if $openzeta == true and $sex == &quot;female&quot;&gt;&gt;team. Or //her// team,&quot; he adds condescendingly in your direction. &quot;The&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;team. The&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; team with the most points only has to do every //other// problem in the assignment.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;The class is definitely interested now.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;if $openzeta == true and $sex == &quot;female&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;To show the value of a good grasp of mathematics,&quot; $geom says, &quot;our first competitors today will be Miss $lastname, who is such an //expert// in building fences--&quot; you cannot ignore the superior, mocking tone in his voice-- &quot;and Mr Myers, who apparently thinks it&#39;s amusing to turn in his homework late every day so far.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Gerald, the class clown, stands and bows, while some of his classmates rag on him for having to compete against a girl.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You fume silently. The intention is clear. $geom doesn&#39;t think girls //belong// in geometry class. Or maybe he just doesn&#39;t think //you// do. But if you beat Gerald, then his buddies are going to ride him all year about losing to you.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;To show the value of a good grasp of mathematics,&quot; $geom says, &quot;our first competitors today will be Mr $lastname, the Boy Scout who is helping his father build fences, and Mr Myers, who apparently thinks it&#39;s amusing to turn in his homework late every day so far.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Gerald, the class clown, stands and bows, while some of his classmates rag on him for having to compete against a girl.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;The teacher&#39;s intention is clear. He&#39;s pitting the Eagle Scout against the layabout in hopes that you beat Gerald soundly and prove something about the value of geometry. But you know that it won&#39;t end well for Gerald. If you defeat him badly, his friends will tease him, and he won&#39;t learn anything.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Yeah, it&#39;s //really// obvious. I mean, look at her,&quot; Gerald says, demonstrating two sizeable cups in front of his chest.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;It&#39;s not funny, Gerald,&quot; you say.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Of //course// it&#39;s funny,&quot; he retorts. &quot;It&#39;s funny that it&#39;s not me.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;This time the laughter is louder. Gerald looks as if he&#39;s quite enjoying the attention. The baseball player, Harold, looks as if he&#39;s about to say something, but thinks better of it.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;$geom stares at you as he tries to bring the class to order, giving you a look as if you&#39;re an unwelcome kind of smudge on his slide rule. &quot;Principal Fordyce advised me there would be a student with Zeta in my class today,&quot; he says after a long, penetrating look. &quot;I had no idea it would be so ... //noticeable.//&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;There is another titter, and you turn pink.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Very well,&quot; he says, &quot;let us proceed.&quot; With a last scowl, he goes on to demonstrate some more proofs that can now be possible with parallel lines.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;The class doesn&#39;t seem to be paying attention. As much as you try to ignore it, you get the feeling that everybody is talking about //you.//&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;It&#39;s Geometry already. Where did the time go?&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Yes, it&#39;s true, we have a new student among us,&quot; $bkp says briskly, clasping his hands together. He&#39;s an older man with a military bearing and a no-nonsense haircut. &quot;If you haven&#39;t already heard, this is Miss $lastname, who will be joining us in Bookkeeping this semester. But don&#39;t worry,&quot; he adds with a condescending smile. &quot;A lot of girls do very well in basic business math, and I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll be just the same.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You can&#39;t help but feel a little stung by this. You&#39;ve been turned into a //girl//, not an imbecile. You&#39;re pretty sure you could still do math if you wanted.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;elseif $secret == true&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;A lot of the students in class are becoming tired and bored by this part of the day. $bkp watches the girls file in and sit down, yawning, at their desks.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;No yawning, ladies,&quot; he says with a condescending smile. &quot;You&#39;ll want your wits about you for today&#39;s lesson.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You can&#39;t help but wonder if he&#39;d treat you the same way if he knew you weren&#39;t a girl any more.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;elseif $oldid == true&gt;&gt;(You are your old self again. The player is start-female. This is impossible on Day 3. If this pops up, it is an ERROR.)


&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;\
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;When everyone is settled, $bkp draws some lines on the board. &quot;All right, girls, today we&#39;re going to be going over the basics of a balance sheet, which is what we&#39;ll be using all year. This is important, so be sure to take very good notes. If you don&#39;t understand this concept, you&#39;re going to find yourself struggling later on.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;//It&#39;s adding and subtracting,// you sigh to yourself. //We&#39;ve been doing this for years. How difficult does he think this is?//&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;&lt;if $day == 4&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Bookkeeping is a bit of a struggle. The class isn&#39;t difficult, but you can&#39;t get the incident with $bully off of your mind.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;if $path.includes(&quot;SO date&quot;) or $path.includes(&quot;friend date&quot;)&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Besides, you&#39;ve got a date tonight, and it&#39;s occupying a large part of your brain. Could this be the secret method for changing back to normal?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Besides, you&#39;re still thinking about what $fr suggested, about finding a way to turn back to normal. There&#39;s //got// to be a way.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;

&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;\
&lt;&lt;if $day == 8&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Today, we are going to talk about the adding machine,&quot; $bkp announces at the start of class. &quot;You will be given the opportunity to use the school adding machines, because they are valuable tools of the modern workplace. We have several Marchants, a couple of Burroughs, and a Victor. All good machines. Perhaps a little older, but typical of what you&#39;ll find in the office.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;There are not enough machines to go around, I&#39;m afraid. Some of you will get them, and others will not. We will rotate these devices throughout the class throughout the semester. However, I am going to award them based on whichever students need them the //least.// If you don&#39;t get a machine, that is because you need //more practice.// Remember, the best adding machine in the world cannot compete with your brain. If you do not understand what you are doing, the adding machine won&#39;t fix your mistakes, and if you understand and apply yourself to the mathematics, you can do it //without// the machine.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;if $openzeta == true and $sex == &quot;male&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;He looks around the class, trying to choose student volunteers. &quot;You,&quot; he says, pointing to Evelyn Cox, &quot;and the young man there. Up to the board please. What&#39;s your name, sir?&quot; $bkp asks you.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;$name,&quot; you reply.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Forgive me,&quot; he says. &quot;I said young man, but I forgot — you&#39;re the one who came to our class with a medical condition. Actually, let&#39;s see if being a man has given you an advantage in mathematics. You never know, do you, girls?&quot; He smiles at the class, amused at his own bigotry, and hands you a piece of chalk as you go to the board.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;He looks around the class, trying to choose student volunteers. &quot;You,&quot; he says, pointing to Evelyn Cox, and turning to you, he says, &quot;and you. To the board, please.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;\
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;When you are in place, he says, &quot;I&#39;m going to read off a column of two-digit numbers. I want you to add them up as quickly as you can. Ready?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Before he even begins, Evelyn is so flustered, she drops her chalk. She&#39;s pretty and popular, but not terribly bright, and very unsure of herself. Maybe you could find a way to give her a boost. But then again, you don&#39;t want to be one of the students slogging through the semester adding things up //by hand.//&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;&lt;if $day == 9&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Fortunately, most of the students in Bookkeeping aren&#39;t interested in whether you&#39;re a boy or a girl. They&#39;re far more focused on which student is going to win the math competition and earn the right to use the adding machines for their in-class assignments.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;\
&lt;&lt;if $day == 10&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Today in Bookkeeping, $bkp explains about double entries, and writes down several uses for a double-entry system on the chalkboard. For some reason, this do not occupy your full attention. You&#39;re more invested in solving the problem of how not to get your clock cleaned by $bully after school tomorrow.&lt;/div&gt;

A number of the girls turn to each other, whispering and giggling, as you take your seat among them.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Oh, a new boy in class?&quot; asks June Morris, looking at you with interest.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Better keep away from this one, Juney,&quot; says Jo Gray. &quot;That&#39;s $name.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Is it? No, it can&#39;t be--&quot; But June can&#39;t finish the sentence. Her eyes pop open wide. &quot;Wait, it //is!// What happened? Did you catch that Zeta thing?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Yes, it looks that way,&quot; says Arlene Stewart.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Ooh, that hair,&quot; Jo says, with a shudder. &quot;I don&#39;t want that to happen to //me.//&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;June isn&#39;t dismayed. &lt;&lt;if $ht gt 175&gt;&gt;&quot;He&#39;s tall, though.&lt;&lt;elseif $strength gt 57&gt;&gt;&quot;He&#39;s strong, though.&lt;&lt;elseif $shoulders gte 36&gt;&gt;&quot;He&#39;s pretty handsome, though.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;&quot;He looks pretty good, though.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; I like that.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;But would you want to wake up like that tomorrow?&quot; asks Ruby Russell snidely. &quot;I wouldn&#39;t.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;There is a murmur of agreement and disapproval among the girls. Arlene Stewart, from English class, looks as if she&#39;s about to say something in your defense, but she changes her mind.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;It&#39;s Bookkeeping already. Where did the time go?&lt;/div&gt;

The instructor is $homeec, a youthful woman with a cheery smile, a Midwestern twang, and a frilly apron over her day dress. She assures the class that she has a science degree in Household Management from the University of Iowa.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;&lt;display &quot;LastClass&quot;&gt;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;In order to run a successful home,&quot; $homeec says in a clear voice, &quot;the modern woman is going to have to know not only how to //use// all of her labor-saving machines, but how to conduct her own repairs. Imagine it, ladies: you&#39;re cooking dinner for your husband, and you&#39;re making a nice aspic. Let&#39;s say you&#39;re making jellied eggs. You&#39;re mixing up the gelatin. Suddenly, the Mixmaster breaks. How are you going to manage?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;The girls exchange concerned looks. &quot;Use a hand beater?&quot; asks Doris Thacker in a timid voice. You remember her from your English class.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Possibly, yes. That&#39;s one way to do it. But after this class,&quot; $homeec says, &quot;you&#39;ll be able to take apart your own Mixmaster and see what&#39;s wrong. You&#39;ll be able to repair that loose wire, or change out a frayed cord, or replace a bad fuse, all by yourself. Not only is it economical, and it will save your family money, but you&#39;ll never have to worry your husband about little household chores like this. That aspic will come out of the refrigerator on time!&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;A girl named Evelyn Cox raises her hand, with a worried look on her face. &quot;$homeec,&quot; she says, &quot;aren&#39;t these machines full of oil and grease and such?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Some of them, yes,&quot; $homeec says gravely, &quot;but with the right soaps and detergents, you&#39;ll be able to clean up any messes. We don&#39;t want you girls to worry about getting your hands dirty. Remember, most of your mothers worked in the factories during the war!&quot; She gives the class an encouraging smile. &quot;And just in case we ever need you young ladies to march off to the factory floors again, we need to make sure you&#39;re familiar with basic household tools.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Somehow, you think another fate might be in store for you, if anybody ever finds out what&#39;s happened underneath your skirt.&lt;/div&gt;

By now, practically everyone in the school knows about you. That&#39;s good //and// bad, you suppose.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;The girls in Home Ec are no exception. A small knot of girls approaches you to say hello, blushing and staring, before retreating back to the other side of the room. Josephine Gray comes over, examining your outfit archly, to comment that she used to have a dress like yours ... when she was twelve. Evelyn Cox helpfully points out that your stocking seams aren&#39;t straight, and fixes them for you.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;The instructor, a cheerful young woman with a Midwestern twang named $homeec, seems almost too enthusiastic about Home Economics for her own good. &quot;Good afternoon, my fabulous little stars!&quot; she says brightly. &quot;Is everybody excited to start thinking about your very first project?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;elseif $secret == true&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Even though it&#39;s the last class of the day, $homeec comes bounding into the room with energy and good cheer. &quot;Good afternoon, my fabulous little stars!&quot; she says brightly. &quot;Is everybody excited to start thinking about your very first project?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Evelyn raises her hand. &quot;$homeec, what if we aren&#39;t very good at sewing?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;That&#39;s only natural,&quot; she says, waving one hand reassuringly. &quot;I know a lot of you gals didn&#39;t get a lot of instructions from your mothers during the war years. Mom was away making shells and airplanes, and didn&#39;t have any time to show you the basics. It&#39;s all right.&quot; Her broad Midwestern twang shows through on the word //right.// &quot;If you don&#39;t know how to baste, or how to do a running stitch or a backstitch, we&#39;ll cover those in class. Chain stitches, blanket stitches, buttons, you name it. Your project is going to have to show that you&#39;ve mastered each and every one of them, and we&#39;ll also be using my electric Singer sewing machine I brought from home.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;What kind of dresses can we make?&quot; asks Doris Thacker, the girl from your English class.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Any kind you like,&quot; $homeec says encouragingly. &quot;I suggest you bring one from home so you can figure out the pattern. That gives you something to go from. You&#39;ll draw up your design and make your changes, choose a fabric, and when you&#39;re all done, you&#39;ll have a brand-new dress that&#39;s entirely your own.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;The girls seem enthusiastic about the idea.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Doesn&#39;t that sound great?&quot; $homeec says, practically bubbling with delight. &quot;But first things first: we&#39;re going to have to take proper measurements for all you gals, in order so you can make your dress the right size. Write these down, because these are the basic measurements we&#39;ll need for all of you.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;The rest of the day is spent with cloth tape measures: around waists and hips, around arms, around wrists, measuring the lengths of arms and legs, even — it&#39;s ticklish to think about — having another girl reaching under your skirt to measure your thighs.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;All around you, the girls are comparing their numbers. &quot;Nineteen inch thighs, Ruby? That&#39;s amazing!&quot; gushes Evelyn. &quot;Mine are twenty-four. I feel like a big cow.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I //can&#39;t// have a twenty-three inch waist, I just //can&#39;t//,&quot; Doris wails to her partner, Josephine. &quot;Scarlett O&#39;Hara&#39;s waist was only seventeen inches!&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Scarlett O&#39;Hara?&quot; asks Jo blankly. &quot;What school does she go to?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;It looks like it&#39;s going to be a long semester.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;display &quot;CleanReturn&quot;&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;\
&lt;&lt;if $day == 4&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Today, $homeec takes the entire class period to talk about different kinds of fabrics, the different ways fabrics can be joined, and what kind of stitches are best. &quot;We can&#39;t cover all of them in one day,&quot; she tells the class, &quot;but I can make sure you gals have a good solid understanding of the right ways to create a seam. Now, if Miss Russell would like to come up to the counter and collect that tray — yes, that one, with the pincushions — we&#39;re going to start with a simple baste. It&#39;s the most basic of stitches, and it will be used for ... does anybody know?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;if $openzeta == true or $newid == true&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;After that, it&#39;s threading needles and practicing your stitching.

&lt;&lt;elseif $secret == true&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;After that, it&#39;s threading needles and practicing your stitching.

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;You didn&#39;t bring anything in?&quot; $homeec asks you with a frown. Somehow, disapproval doesn&#39;t sound as bad in a Midwestern twang. &quot;Well, I&#39;m sorry, but you&#39;re going to have to choose something today.

&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You were so busy worrying about your doctor&#39;s appointment on Monday that you forgot to check what the Home Ec assignment would be.

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;But ... wouldn&#39;t I have to take it off?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;It&#39;ll be fine, ain&#39;t nobody going to see you. A number of the other girls are doing that. Besides, we&#39;ve got the shades pulled down.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;So that&#39;s how you end up in the Home Ec room, standing around a work table in your girlfriend&#39;s bra and panties, taking measurements off her dress with a cloth tape. Her orange sweater clashes badly with your pink blushes every time one of the other girls comes near, or says anything to you.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Josephine Gray, across the table from you, seems completely unrattled.

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;It&#39;ll be fine. You&#39;re a girl half the time anyway, so there ain&#39;t nobody going to care. A number of the girls are down to slips and chemises. Besides, we&#39;ve got the shades pulled down.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;So that&#39;s how you end up in the Home Ec room with a bunch of girls, your shirt and tie removed, leaning over a worktable to take measurements off of your shirt. The amount of attention you&#39;re getting from the girls is embarrassing, and there&#39;s a bit of a struggle for elbow room because so many of them seem to be want to be at your worktable.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Josephine Gray, across the table from you, seems completely unrattled. Then again, she does pageants in her spare time, and she&#39;s hardly ever rattled by //anything.// &quot;Don&#39;t worry about them,&quot; she assures you in that cool, steady voice. &quot;They would see much more if they spent any time backstage.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;elseif $path.includes(&quot;gingham dress&quot;)&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I understand, but you must have //something.// Why don&#39;t you make a pattern from that gingham dress you have on?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I&#39;ll just do one of the other dress patterns,&quot; you stammer. There&#39;s no //way// you can strip out of your dress while you&#39;re still a boy underneath. The charade would fall apart at once.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;If you like,&quot; $homeec says, moving away.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;So that&#39;s how you end up standing at a worktable in the Home Ec room, looking through a dog-eared magazine and trying to find a dress that you&#39;d be willing to wear. Most of them seem pretty ancient. //Who would wear these?// you think, thumbing another page over.&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Some of the other girls, braver than you -- and probably not secretly boys -- are stripped down to chemises and slips, bras and panties, measuring their clothes. Or they had the foresight to //bring// dresses, which is something you ought to have done.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Josephine Gray, across the table from you, seems completely unrattled. Then again, she does pageants in her spare time, and she&#39;s hardly ever rattled by //anything.// &quot;You shouldn&#39;t be so worried about being in your underthings,&quot; she tells you in that cool, steady voice. &quot;You&#39;d see much more if you spent any time backstage.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;&lt;set $path.delete(&quot;gingham dress&quot;)&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;set $path.push(&quot;flapper dress&quot;)&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;elseif $sex == &quot;female&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;It&#39;ll be fine, ain&#39;t nobody going to see you. A number of the other girls are doing that. Besides, we&#39;ve got the shades pulled down.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;So that&#39;s how you end up in the Home Ec room, standing around a work table in just a bra and panties and your white cardigan, taking measurements off your dress with a cloth tape. Some of the other girls are doing the same, and there are a lot of pink, embarrassed faces.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Josephine Gray, across the table from you, seems completely unrattled. Then again, she does pageants in her spare time, and she&#39;s hardly ever rattled by //anything.// &quot;It&#39;s not that bad,&quot; she assures you in that cool, steady voice. &quot;It&#39;s much worse than this backstage.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;He didn&#39;t know much,&quot; you admit. &quot;Basically what the article said. They&#39;re still trying to figure out what&#39;s causing it, and what to do about it.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;What, so you&#39;re just going to keep changing?&quot; asks Ruby Russell. She&#39;s from a rich family, and her father works at Boeing. &quot;Just back and forth, any time you want? Eww.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;You can change //any time you want?//&quot; Phyllis Watson, captain of the Pep Squad, claps her hands in glee. &quot;I know //I// would do that if I could.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;You would?&quot; Ruby asks. &quot;Ugh, why?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;To find out what my boyfriend is doing when I&#39;m not there!&quot; Her eyes widen with realization as she looks at you. &quot;You could //do// that,&quot; she gasps. &quot;You could go find out if Ted is asking me to &lt;&lt;if $sex == &quot;female&quot;&gt;&gt;Homecoming. You know, not //now.// When you&#39;re a boy again.&quot;&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;Homecoming.&quot;&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;$nomcap[_tempgen] could give us advice on our outfits,&quot; says Evelyn Cox, &quot;and tell us what the boys will like.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Yes,&quot; Jo Gray says in a thoughtful tone. &quot;And $nom[_tempgen] could get their telephone numbers, since we&#39;re not supposed to ask.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Another girl grins wickedly. &quot;We could practice //kissing.//&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Oooh, and //parking,// even,&quot; says another.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;It&#39;s so mysterious,&quot; your teacher says. &quot;A couple of them go to our school? I tell you what, we never saw anything like this in Missouri when //I// went to school.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;&lt;set _tempgen to 4&gt;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;It&#39;s new to us, too, $homeec,&quot; says Doris. &quot;I&#39;ve never heard of it before either.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;What, so they just keep changing?&quot; asks Ruby Russell. She&#39;s from a rich family, and her father works at Boeing. &quot;Just back and forth, any time they want? Eww.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;To find out what my boyfriend is doing when I&#39;m not there,&quot; she says with satisfaction.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Yes, but that means a boy could be spying on //you,//&quot; Ruby counters.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;They could sneak into the locker room and peek,&quot; says Evelyn Cox, shuddering.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;And listen to everything we&#39;re saying about then,&quot; adds Jo Gray in a thoughtful tone.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Another girl puts her hand to her mouth in horror. &quot;What if your //boyfriend// is one? You&#39;d be kissing a //girl.//&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Or worse,&quot; says another girl, in tones of wicked glee.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;\
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;This seems to shake $homeec to her senses. &quot;Now girls,&quot; she says, &quot;Let&#39;s not be lewd. We will strive to be young ladies today. Let&#39;s get back to our lessons. We&#39;ve wasted enough class time on this. So — today we&#39;re going to talk about different fabrics, and what kind of stitching works best for each one. Some of you are making dresses for Homecoming, so you&#39;ll want to pay attention. Some dress fabrics are tricky as the devil to work with.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;A paper cutout can be very helpful,&quot; $homeec tells the class. &quot;If your sizes aren&#39;t just right, or your seams don&#39;t line up, this is where you&#39;re going to notice. Don&#39;t forget you&#39;re going to want to do left and right sides separately, so you can set them out on the fabric to make sure you have enough. And //label// them, girls! The last thing you want is to cut out your expensive velvet or silk and realize it&#39;s the wrong side out!&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;if $path.includes(&quot;oops&quot;)&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You sit at your worktable in your shirt and tie, trying to ignore the way the girls in the class circulate around you. Walking past. Brushing your muscula arms as they go by. Sitting at your table to pick through the jar of pencils and pens. Saying hello. It seems like they&#39;re taking every opportunity to inspect the Zeta Chromosome&#39;s handiwork. The ringleaders are Evelyn, Jo, and Ruby, who were also in your Bookkeeping class. And it doesn&#39;t end until the bell rings.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You sit at your worktable, cutting out paper patterns for your project, staring at the scissors and unable to concentrate. School is almost over.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;This!&quot; he calls out gruffly, holding up his disfigured hand. &quot;This, boys, is the kind of thing that can happen to you, if you don&#39;t listen carefully to me and you don&#39;t use the proper safety equipment in this class. I will be signing you off on every piece of equipment in my shop before you are allowed to touch it. You see the yellow lines on the floor? Right there, around the band saw, and the lathe? Those are your safety lines. If you&#39;re not using that tool, you must stand behind that yellow line. Yes, you,&quot; he says, pointing to a boy with a raised hand.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;How did you lose your fingers?&quot; asks Ralph Ward. He&#39;s a tall, blond young man who happens to be the new quarterback this year.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;In the war,&quot; $shop says, looking down. &quot;It&#39;s a story for later. I&#39;ll tell you boys some other time.&quot; He seems uncomfortable, and moves on quickly. &quot;Believe me, you do not want to lose part of your hand! Imagine not being able to go fishing, or shoot a bow at summer camp. Imagine not being able to work at your father&#39;s store because you can&#39;t carry anything heavy.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;//I can imagine it,// you think to yourself.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;And that is why I expect each one of you to pay close attention. If I see you daydreaming or lollygagging, I will send you out of class for the day, and you will get a zero on attendance. No exceptions.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Are we going to work on any metals this year?&quot; asks one boy.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Raise your hand first, Paul. No, we are not doing any metals this year. The Industrial Arts program has expanded to a second course, just for metalworking and machining, so if you would rather be in that course, talk to the school secretary and get your class changed. Yes, you.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Ralph speaks, his eyes still fixed on $shop&#39;s mangled right hand. &quot;What if we don&#39;t want to take shop any more? I don&#39;t want to injure my throwing hand.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;It&#39;s mandatory,&quot; $shop says curtly. &quot;These are skills every boy should learn. You can&#39;t be much of a man unless you can fix things up around the house.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;//There&#39;s another qualification,// you think. //And right now, I don&#39;t meet it.//&lt;/div&gt;

By now, practically everyone in the school knows about you. That&#39;s good //and// bad, you suppose.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;The boys in Wood Shop are no exception. A couple of them are eyeing you suspiciously, as if searching for signs that you might not belong. Apparently they don&#39;t see anything that provokes them, because mostly the reaction you receive is total indifference.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;The teacher is a grizzled old man with a cast eye named $shop, who is missing the first two fingers on his right hand, and who has a habit of emphasizing the rules of wood shop safety by recalling gruesome shop accidents. He has a story for every machine, a foolhardy and errant young lad for every occasion. It&#39;s morbidly fascinating somehow.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;elseif $secret == true&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;$shop begins today&#39;s lessons with another round of his favorite hobby, wherein he illustrates the need for wood shop safety by recalling gruesome shop accidents. He has a story for every machine, a foolhardy and errant young lad for every occasion. It&#39;s morbidly fascinating somehow.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;elseif $oldid == true&gt;&gt;(You are your old self again. We may assume the player is start-male. This is impossible on Day 3. If this pops up, it is an ERROR.)


&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;\
&lt;&lt;set $newknowns to [25, 10]&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;display &quot;NewKnowns&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;A couple of years ago, some kid, who wasn&#39;t following the rules about safety near the band saw, he stepped across the yellow line, and turned around too fast without looking and cut off the tip of his thumb. Now you boys,&quot; $shop says sternly, glaring around with rheumy eyes, &quot;you //listen// when I tell you to be careful with this equipment, or that could happen to you.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;After that, he passes out a short quiz about shop safety regarding the band saw. The pages are damp and smell of fresh mimeograph ink, and most of the questions are crudely phrased, multiple-choice, and obvious. You doubt whether he spends much time writing them. Or grading them.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;All right, boys,&quot; he says, when he has collected the pages, &quot;you are going to be working on several projects this semester, but you should start thinking about your final project now. Maybe you want to build a new box for your tools, or for fishing tackle. You could make a wooden rack for your father&#39;s easy chair, to hold his pipe and newspapers. Maybe you&#39;d like to make your best girl a jewelry box for her pretty things. It&#39;s up to you. Your project has to be sanded and finished, it has to have hardware attached — a hinge or a latch or a lid, something like that. Tt has to have at least one seamless joint. And it has to have at least one fitted angle and one curve. It can&#39;t all be easy straight lines. Yes — Ralph.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Can I do a glass case for a football?&quot; asks Ralph Ward, the new sophomore quarterback.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Why, you planning on //winning?//&quot; asks Paul Sanders with a nasty grin.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Yes, a case will be fine, if it has a hinged lid. Anyone else? Yes, you —&quot; $shop consults his sketch of the students at their workbenches. &quot;Jack Kelly?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;The boy with the raised hand nods. &quot;Y-yes. Uh, what about a n-new, a n-n-new b-butt for my b-b-BB gun?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;No join on that,&quot; $shop says disapprovingly. &quot;No hardware. Unless you take a flat bit and drill out a space in the back, make a little carrying space for extra BBs.&quot; The old man rubs his whiskered chin. &quot;If you take a couple smaller pieces of walnut and laminate them together...&quot; He shrugs. &quot;Talk to me after class about that one.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;After that, all the boys are calling out their ideas, often forgetting to raise their hands. It becomes a free-for-all discussion forum on various things they could build, if only they had the knowledge.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I know you&#39;re all excited,&quot; $shop says at last. &quot;Most of you grew up, your fathers were off in Europe fighting. They didn&#39;t have time to raise you good and teach you proper tool use. Well, we&#39;re going to take care of that in this class, give you boys a firm foundation on what it means to be a man.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You&#39;re not sure whether that&#39;s possible at this point, but given the week you&#39;ve had, you wouldn&#39;t rule it out.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;display &quot;CleanReturn&quot;&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;\
&lt;&lt;if $day == 4&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Today, $shop spends the entire day talking about different kinds of wood, different grains and hardness, and things to watch out for. &quot;Green wood,&quot; he says, &quot;that&#39;s going to warp on you as it dries out. It&#39;ll get you every time, bend all over the place, like it&#39;s moving on its own. Always check your wood. You want good, hard wood, nice and straight, no curves or bends or twists.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;The way $shop keeps talking about &quot;wood&quot; causes all the boys in class to stiffle a snicker.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;$shop,&quot; says Glenn Baker with a straight face, &quot;what if your wood is too big?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Another round of snorts goes around the room. Paul Sanders hides his face to conceal a smirk.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;You should always look for wood that&#39;s close to the right size,&quot; $shop replies, oblivious. &quot;It minimizes waste. But make sure to measure. Better too big than too small.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;if $openzeta == true or $newid == true&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;For the first time, it occurs to you to wonder whether your &quot;wood&quot; is too big or too small. Do all boys worry about this?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;elseif $secret == true&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You wonder for a moment whether your &quot;wood&quot; is too big or too small, before it occurs to you that you have no way to measure it. Your wood is AWOL at the moment.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;elseif $oldid == true&gt;&gt;(Could be male or female. This is impossible on Day 4. If this pops up, it is an ERROR.)


&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;\
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Then $shop starts talking about nailing and screwing, and you begin to despair of learning anything in this class.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;\
&lt;&lt;if $day == 8&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Today in shop class, $shop goes over the basics: drawing, drafting, measuring, and marking.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;This,&quot; he says, holding up a metal triangle, &quot;is a speed square. This one&#39;s a, er, it&#39;s a Swanson, I think--&quot; he checks the markings on the side-- &quot;yes, a Swanson, but there are other kinds hanging up on the tool rack in back. Mr Kelly, point to the speed squares for the class, please.&quot; After Jack sits down again, $shop continues. &quot;You&#39;ve all heard the old saying. Measure...&quot; he pauses, working it out. &quot;Measure twice, cut once. Yes. I get that backward sometimes, which is why the saying is there. Think before you act. If you&#39;re marking an angle too quickly and you&#39;re not squared up -- hand me that piece of scrap there, would you? -- and you&#39;re not squared up, you get a crooked line, like this.&quot; He demonstrates, then holds up the board. &quot;Always make sure when you&#39;re using a speed square that you&#39;re flush up against the side, grasp your wood firmly and hold it down on the table, and //then// make your mark.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Grasp our wood firmly,&quot; says Paul Sanders, as he writes it down.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Think you can handle that?&quot; murmurs Gordon Baker.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I&#39;m an //expert,//&quot; Paul whispers back.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;&lt;set $newknowns to [4, 21]&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;display &quot;NewKnowns&quot;&gt;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Today, I&#39;ve got both our table saws set up with a miter attachment. I want you all to mark down a thirty degree angle two inches from the end of your board, and you&#39;re going to make that cut. I will check your work with a ... let&#39;s see ...&quot; He fishes around under the papers on his worktable, then holds up a little wooden contraption. &quot;It&#39;s a little jig I made, you see, you just put the wood in the slot like that, and you move this peg if you want to check the angle. The peg is attached here on this leather thong so I don&#39;t lose it. That way I can check your work very quickly.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;So we&#39;re //all// supposed to stick our wood in the slot?&quot; asks Gordon with a smirk.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Yes, you should all finish this before the end of class,&quot; says $shop, oblivious.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;if $openzeta == true and $sex == &quot;female&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;All except //her,//&quot; says Paul, pointing to you. &quot;She doesn&#39;t have any wood.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;$shop, Gordon doesn&#39;t have any wood,&quot; says Paul.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;\
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;There&#39;s lots of scrap wood in the bin,&quot; says $shop.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You can&#39;t believe it. //Nobody could be this clueless,// you think.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;&lt;set $cleanlink to &quot;continue&quot;&gt;&gt;

&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;\
&lt;&lt;if $day == 9&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;The boys in Wood Shop mutter a bit among themselves about the article in the //Aerie.// It clearly makes some of them uncomfortable.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;&lt;set $newknowns to [10, 25, 11, 4]&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;display &quot;NewKnowns&quot;&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;if $openzeta == true&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;So, that article,&quot; asks Ralph awkwardly, scratching his neck. &quot;That really happened?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Most of it,&quot; you say. &quot;The article got some things wrong.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;And you&#39;re okay with &lt;&lt;if $startsex == &quot;male&quot;&gt;&gt;being a girl&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;being a boy&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; sometimes?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;It&#39;s okay,&quot; you admit. &quot;It&#39;s not as different as you&#39;d think. Mostly it&#39;s the clothes, and how people treat you.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;So, that article, did you see it?&quot; asks Ralph awkwardly, rubbing the back of his neck. &quot;You guys reckon that really happens? Boys turning into girls?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;\
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;What&#39;s going on, Ward?&quot; laughs Gordon Baker. &quot;Don&#39;t want to be quarterback any more?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;No, I just think it&#39;s a gas,&quot; he says. &quot;Wouldn&#39;t you think it&#39;s keen if your best girl understood all the guy stuff you like?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;He wouldn&#39;t know,&quot; says Marvin Long. &quot;He&#39;s never //had// a best girl.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;You shut up!&quot; Gordon growls.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;$shop drones on about the band saw, without noticing anything going on behind him. &quot;--tricky, because the width of the blade is ... let&#39;s see, it&#39;s pert near three-eights of an inch, and that means your turning radius ... I bet that&#39;s darn close to, mmm, inch and a half. I&#39;d just use a jigsaw for that, if it&#39;s me doing it--&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I know //I// w-w-wouldn&#39;t mind t-turning into a girl once in a w-w-while,&quot; says Jack Kelly.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;So you could get a date?&quot; Gordon is happy to turn the joke onto someone else.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;N-no, so I c-could go into the g-g-guh, into the g-girls&#39; l-locker room. W-why else?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;if $openzeta == true&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;The boys around you contemplate the idea, and turn to you. &quot;Can you really do that?&quot; asks Marvin. &quot;You could tell us what they all look like, all in the nude and everything?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Sure,&quot; you say with a grin. &lt;&lt;if $sex == &quot;male&quot;&gt;&gt;&quot;But aren&#39;t you worried I&#39;d be telling them all about //you?//&quot;&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;&quot;And believe me, they&#39;d asking about //you// guys, too.&quot;&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;There are some withdrawn looks. They don&#39;t like that idea at all.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Hey, would you be able to ask one to prom?&quot; Gordon jokes, to break the ice. &quot;Not for me. For J-J-Jack, here. I&#39;m sure you could use the help, right, buddy?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Oh, d-d-def-definitely,&quot; Jack replies with a smile.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;The boys around you contemplate the idea. &quot;You know,&quot; says Marvin, &quot;if I got turned into a girl, I couldn&#39;t play football.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Yeah, that&#39;s t-true,&quot; says Jack.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;What if that happened to the whole //team?//&quot; Gordon asks.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Forfeit,&quot; Marvin groans.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;W-what if the c-c-communists d-did it to the whole army?&quot; asks Jack. &quot;Then what?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Then you&#39;d be able to join, wouldn&#39;t you?&quot; Gordon asks with a laugh.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;\
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;There are some laughs, and a couple of slapped backs. After that, the boys seem to lose interest, and turn their attention back to $shop. Boys love their toys, after all.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Don&#39;t remind me,&quot; you sigh.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;if $path.includes(&quot;help Gerald&quot;)&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Ralph and I will be there,&quot; he assures you. &quot;$bully is all mouth. If you need a hand holding $acc[$bgen] off, just let me know.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;You&#39;re going to do at least three views,&quot; he says, &quot;so make sure to leave yourself room for all three. Top view, front view, side view. Gordon, you&#39;re doing //four// views, because that baseball bat holder isn&#39;t going to be symmetrical on both ends. Here&#39;s what I do -- I like to take my speed square and draw up a little L right next to the drawing and put down a scale, so I can keep them consistent. Here&#39;s an L for the front view ... and an L for the side view ... this&#39;ll be the //left// side, let&#39;s say, but you could do the right side, it doesn&#39;t matter.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;

It means you&#39;ll have to spend the next several hours close to the toilet, and that makes you reconsider the idea of playing sick. You can&#39;t keep this up forever or you&#39;ll have to sleep in the bathroom until you turn eighteen.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Apart from that, however, she leaves you to your own devices. At eight-thirty, she announces that she&#39;s leaving to drive $sibnick to school, which starts a little later than yours. &quot;And then I&#39;ll go to the grocery store,&quot; she calls up the stairs. &quot;If I&#39;m making chicken soup, we&#39;ll need a few things.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Thanks, Mom!&quot; you call back.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;If you&#39;re feeling up to it,&quot; she says, &quot;you might have a hot bath while I&#39;m out. I find that helps me sometimes.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Okay!&quot; You feel strange shouting, as if Mom is going to recognize some change in your voice.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;But she doesn&#39;t say anything about it. A few minutes later and you hear $sib thundering down the stairs, then back up to retrieve her forgotten satchel, then back down again. The front door closes with a click. You hear the sound of Mom&#39;s old Packard starting fitfully to life. It drives away.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;The house falls eerily silent.&lt;/div&gt;
--[[go check yourself in the hall mirror|1948 Skip First Day][$page to 1]]

&lt;&lt;if $page == 1&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You haven&#39;t really had a proper chance to do this. A brief survey, if that, in the bathroom. Now that the house is yours and there&#39;s no danger of anyone walking in on you, you rush to the full-length mirror hanging at the top of the stairs. &lt;&lt;if $startsex == &quot;female&quot;&gt;&gt;You have a vanity mirror, but it&#39;s fairly small, and it&#39;s set at desk height.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;You have a small facial mirror for combing your hair, but it&#39;s small and doesn&#39;t show much.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; The mirror in the hall is better.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You peel off your &lt;&lt;if $startsex == &quot;female&quot;&gt;&gt;nightgown, your girdle, and all your layers of underwear,&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;pajama top and bottom, kick off your underwear, &lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; and get a good look at what you&#39;re dealing with.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;if $startsex == &quot;female&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You&#39;re a boy, all right. There&#39;s no doubt about it. Your whole body says so.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Your shoulders are about the same width, maybe a bit broader, and you have slightly more muscle. There&#39;s a few little tufts of hair on your chest, and your boobs are so flat — disappeared entirely, actually — that you can see the pectorals underneath. There&#39;s even a faint trail of hairs on your belly leading downward from your navel. And hairs on your shoulders. And hairs on your forearms. Hairs everywhere.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Your hands are a tiny bit bigger. Not much, but a little. Your chin seems a fraction more square, and your brow slightly more prominent. If you didn&#39;t know better, at first glance you&#39;d say this was the face of a teenage boy. But it&#39;s still you. You frown at your face closely, running your fingers on your chin. No signs of stubble, but maybe just a few wipsy hairs on your upper lip.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;And the penis, of course. It hangs there, getting in the way, a shaft and a hanging sack containing your testicles, sitting there like a new student in class you&#39;ve never met before. It&#39;s hard to stand in the usual way, feet close, thighs pressed together. You feel pinched up, like your balls need a little room to breathe. When your feet are spread apart, it&#39;s much more comfortable.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You&#39;re a girl, all right. There&#39;s no doubt about it. Your whole body says so.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Your shoulders are a fraction more narrow, and your arms seem to have lost some muscle. They look like pipestems. You weren&#39;t all that strong before, but now you look practically anemic. The wisps of chest hair that you had been carefully cultivating are gone, as is the hair on your lower belly. Even the hair on your arms is finer and fainter than before. And your nipples seem prouder. Puffier. Your chest, never in the league of a Charles Atlas to begin with, seems oddly squishy.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Your hands are a tiny bit smaller and more slender. Not so much that you&#39;d notice unless you knew what to look for. Your chin seems less prominent, your jaw more delicate. If you didn&#39;t know better, at first glance you&#39;d say this was the face of a teenage girl. But it&#39;s still you. You frown at your face closely, running your fingers on your chin. No signs of stubble. None at all. Not even those telltale little hairs on your upper lip.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;And your cock is missing, of course. It used to just //be// there, like an old friend, whenever you glanced at yourself. Now it&#39;s absent, like a student suddenly missing from class who leaves an empty desk behind. There&#39;s nothing there except a small breeze between your legs that makes you feel peculiarly vulnerable. If you stand with your feet close and your thighs pressed together, that feeling is a little less bothersome.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;\
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Okay, $name,&quot; you tell your naked reflection. &quot;Now what?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
--[[take a bath|1948 Skip First Day][$page to 3]]
&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;\
&lt;&lt;if $page == 2&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You&#39;ve been ravenously hungry ever since you woke up. It&#39;s time for some breakfast.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Checking to make sure the coast is clear, even though you&#39;re positive that Mom has already left, you creep down the stairs. There&#39;s no sign of anyone, so you relax and head for the kitchen.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;There&#39;s a little Malt-O-Meal left on the stovetop, although all the rest of the breakfast dishes have been scrubbed and tucked away in the drainage rack beside the sink. You manage to eat some — cold, unfortunately — and that helps a little. Now you don&#39;t feel quite so empty.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;The remains of Dad&#39;s morning newspaper are strewn about the kitchen table. All the sections have been separated, folded backward, and turned this way and that. This is usually how he leaves the newspaper in the morning. Mom has a look through the headlines and flips through the classified ads, then she tidies it away. Eventually the newspaper ends up in the firewood storage bin next to the kindling.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;As you glance over the newspaper, the word //polio// catches your eye.&lt;/div&gt;
--[[check newspaper about polio|1948 Skip First Day][$page to 4, $path.push(&quot;polio newspaper&quot;)]]
&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;\
&lt;&lt;if $page == 3&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Since your mother mentioned it, you decide a hot bath might help you throw off some of this worry. It might not change you back to normal, but it certainly couldn&#39;t hurt. There&#39;s even some soap flakes, so you can have a nice modest bubble bath, &lt;&lt;if $startsex == &quot;male&quot;&gt;&gt;although it&#39;s going to make you feel a bit like Ava Gardner in //One Touch of Venus//, that movie $so dragged you to last month.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;just like Ava Gardner in //One Touch of Venus//, that movie you dragged $so to last month.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;At first, it&#39;s quite relaxing. The hot water washes away your accumulated tension, and the mounds of bubbles conceal the shape of your body beneath the water so you don&#39;t have to think about it.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;But bubbles can only do so much, and eventually your hands brush up against the wrong bit of flesh, or your thighs slide together from all that slippery soap, and you notice all over again that your body isn&#39;t the same shape as it always was. Your very skin is no longer so familiar to you.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Should you try to acquaint yourself with your body? Explore with your hands? You have to clean yourself, after all.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;With your hands, you start exploring your new flesh. Gingerly. Guiltily. It goes against everything your &lt;&lt;if $startsex == &quot;female&quot;&gt;&gt;mother says, about how good Girl Scouts don&#39;t get merit badges playing panty polo.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;father says, that you&#39;ll never make Eagle Scout by getting merit badges in pocket pool.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; On the other hand, $thisgym is always going on about &quot;hygiene,&quot; which means cleanliness, and you&#39;ve never //been// in this shape before, so you&#39;re sure it&#39;s never been cleaned.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You &lt;&lt;if $startsex == &quot;female&quot;&gt;&gt;touch your new penis daintily, withdrawing quickly, but nothing happens. It doesn&#39;t do anything. It certainly shows no signs of becoming enormous and randy, like Mildred Sacks said penises do sometimes. There&#39;s just some extra flesh there. You can touch it and pull it, but it remains inert.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;prod yourself down there, going by feel, not sure what you&#39;ll find. There is some pliable flesh, like lips, with a warm opening in between if you poke around a little. Nothing unusual happens. Tentatively, you feel around and find a little knob of flesh. That must be the magic button, which is what Jimmy O&#39;Toole called that secret part of a woman that makes her go crazy for you. But this little nub doesn&#39;t seem to do anything.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Disappointed, you finish your bath. You were half-expecting some big, exciting sensations from your new equipment. Changing into a $girlboy[$gen] hardly seems worth the trouble so far.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;There&#39;s got to be //somebody// you can talk to about all of this.&lt;/div&gt;
--[[call doctor|1948 Skip First Day][$page to 5, $path.push(&quot;call doctor&quot;)]]
&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;\
&lt;&lt;if $page == 4&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;The headline reads MORE BAD NEWS FOR KIND POLIO VACCINE.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You turn the newspaper toward you and read the article. Apparently, a number of years ago a doctor named Horace Kind had run some experiments on a new polio vaccine. It hadn&#39;t worked out, of course, because Mom and Pop were still flipping out about the dangers of polio.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You check the rest of the headlines. There&#39;s another suspected outbreak, this one in Auburn, which is not too far from here. That must have been what they were hinting at last night.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;//Wait a minute, maybe that&#39;s what this is,// you think. //It&#39;s some new kind of ... $girlboy[$gen] disease, and I happened to catch it somehow.//&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;The headlines on the front page don&#39;t mention anything about any such disease. It just goes on about HUAC, an acronym that seems familiar. The House Unamerican Affairs Committee, according to the article. Communists being investigated everywhere. Alger Hiss. That&#39;s right, you remember now. No sign of any mysterious disease affecting teenagers in the Puget Sound area.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;If anybody would know anything about such a disease, your family doctor might.&lt;/div&gt;
--[[call doctor|1948 Skip First Day][$page to 5, $path.push(&quot;call doctor&quot;)]]
&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;\
&lt;&lt;if $page == 5&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Dr Bennett&#39;s number is written on a smudged piece of piece of paper and tacked to a small corkboard beside the kitchen telephone. You haven&#39;t had to call this number since $sibnick fell down the porch steps and broke her arm a few summers ago.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Doctor Bennett&#39;s office,&quot; says a chirpy receptionist.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Hi, my name is $name &lt;&lt;textbox &quot;$lastname&quot; $lastname&gt;&gt;. My mom takes me to your office sometimes. May I speak with Dr Bennett?&quot; you ask.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;She asks you to spell your name, and you can hear her busily thumbing through some files. &quot;Kendall,&quot; she says triumphantly. &quot;Hold, please, while I see if the doctor is in.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Moments later, a man&#39;s voice comes on the line. &quot;This is Bob Bennett.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Unable to contain yourself, you launch into an explanation of your strange morning, rushing through all the feelings of oddness in your new body, your concern that you have no idea how it happened, having to skip school, not knowing how to change back, and hoping your parents don&#39;t find out about it. Dr Bennett listens carefully on the other end, occasionally making noises of confirmation and asking questions.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Finally, he clears his throat. &quot;Well, I suppose I could make time to see you this afternoon. I remember reading about something like this before, but it&#39;s been a few months, and it didn&#39;t seem all that reliable at the time. Would three o&#39;clock do?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Uh, yes, I suppose,&quot; you say. &quot;I&#39;m home from school all day. I was just hoping—&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Hoping that Irene — your mother — doesn&#39;t find out, eh?&quot; he asks knowingly. &quot;Don&#39;t worry. I&#39;ll do a quick exam in your room, if that&#39;s all right with you.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;That sounds about as good an arrangement as you could expect, so you agree and hang up.&lt;/div&gt;
--[[go back to your bedroom|1948 Skip First Day][$page to 6]]
&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;\
&lt;&lt;if $page == 6&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You rush back to your bedroom just in time. Mom&#39;s car pulls up in the driveway just as you&#39;re crawling back into bed.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;For the next few hours, you hear pots and pans clanking in the kitchen as you sit alone in your bedroom, your mind racing. You&#39;re still a $girlboy[$gen] and it&#39;s been //hours.// Nothing has changed.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You try to sleep, but you can&#39;t quite drift off. Who knows what would happen if you let your eyes slip shut?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;It must be hours later when Mom knocks on the door. &quot;Would you like some soup?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
--[[eat lunch|1948 Skip First Day][$page to 7]]
&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;\
&lt;&lt;if $page == 7&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You&#39;re still ravenously hungry, so you eat three bowls of soup before it finally feels like you&#39;re getting filled up. Whatever happened to your body last night, it must have taken a lot of effort.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Mom comes to collect the bowl a little later, commenting happily on how your appetite seems to be coming back. Perhaps you overdid it a little on the soup.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;if $path.includes(&quot;call doctor&quot;)&gt;&gt;--[[wait for Dr Bennett|1948 Skip First Day][$page to 8]]&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;--[[try to take a nap|1948 Skip First Day][$page to 9]]&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;\
&lt;&lt;if $page == 8&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You while away the hours until your appointment by trying to nap, but it doesn&#39;t seem to work.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Eventually, you hear the sound of the telephone downstairs. After a few minutes of muffled speech, Mom climbs the stairs to your bedroom and informs you that Dr Bennett will be a little late. &quot;Did you ask the doctor to make a house call?&quot; she asks, worried.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;He offered,&quot; you say, without elaborating.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Ah. Well, that&#39;s all right. Shall I send him up when he arrives?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Dr Bennett is a man of middle years with glasses, graying hair, a heavy-set frame, and a rather jowly face. He usually smells of antiseptic and sometimes of gin. Mom lets him into your room without a word, and he sets down a black leather bag on your desk.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Good to see you again, $name,&quot; he says in a kind, gruff voice, adjusting his head mirror. &quot;Shall we see what you&#39;re dealing with?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;He makes you undress halfway, and performs a brief and professional inspection of the key areas of your body. With a grunt, he rises to his feet, gesturing for you to &lt;&lt;if $startsex == &quot;male&quot;&gt;&gt;pull up your pajamas.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;pull up your panties and fix your nightgown.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; &quot;Well, I see what you&#39;re talking about,&quot; he says after a moment, puzzled. &quot;I&#39;ll be dipped if I can figure out why it happened, though. I think I&#39;ll try to find out where I read about that other case. Must have been a medical journal. Don&#39;t think it was the newspaper.&quot; He conks himself genially on the head with one fist. &quot;Getting old, I guess.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;if $path.includes(&quot;polio newspaper&quot;)&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I was reading about polio in the newspaper today,&quot; you say. &quot;Maybe this is some new-fangled disease or other, do you think?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Disease? Hard to say. I&#39;ve never seen a disease like ... wait a minute. Polio, polio.&quot; Dr Bennett frowns. &quot;There was a polio vaccine trial with some odd side effects. I think your mother was a part of it. Maybe — okay, $name, I know you&#39;re anxious to find out what&#39;s happened to you, but this is just a hypothesis, so don&#39;t mention it to anyone. Not yet. I&#39;m probably remembering it wrong. Let me find that old medical journal and look up this case. I&#39;ll call around, too. Maybe Dr Lambert or Dr Phillips remembers the details.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I promise,&quot; you say, holding up one hand, like you do when you take your scouting oaths every weekend.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;\
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;What about school?&quot; you ask. &quot;I can&#39;t go like this, can I?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;That&#39;s a good point,&quot; he says, rubbing the white stubble on his chin. &quot;I tell you what. I can write the school a note that will excuse you from your gym classes. Would that do the trick?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Oh, yes please, sir.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Good,&quot; he says, getting out his notepad. &quot;You just take this with you and show it to your teachers. They can call me if they have any questions. I won&#39;t //tell// them anything,&quot; he adds, seeing the look on your face. &quot;Not unless you want me to.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; he says, shaking his head and sucking his front teeth. &quot;You wouldn&#39;t be able to keep that kind of secret from your parents. Otherwise, what would you wear? Would you change clothes along the way somehow? And the school would have to know why the //real// you has stopped going, otherwise they&#39;d be sure to send a truant officer to talk to your parents and ask why you aren&#39;t at school. If that&#39;s what you prefer, I suppose I can&#39;t stop you, but I don&#39;t know how long you&#39;d get away with a scheme like that. It would fall apart in a day or two, I think. I don&#39;t advise that you try it.&quot; Without waiting for a response, he begins packing his black bag and prepares to leave. &quot;In fact, if you&#39;re going to try a scheme like that, I&#39;d prefer not to know about it.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;&lt;if $page == 10&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I won&#39;t tell the school anything, unless you ask me to,&quot; Dr Bennett assures you. &quot;It&#39;s part of the Hippocratic Oath. The World Medical Association in Geneva just issued a statement about secrecy, only this year. As a doctor, I don&#39;t say any more than is necessary.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Oh, good.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Of course, if I discover that what you have is some kind of communicable disease, and there are other people at risk,&quot; Dr Bennett says, beginning to pack his black bag, &quot;then I would have to tell the King County board of health. But I wouldn&#39;t worry about that right now. Let me look into this condition of yours first, and I&#39;ll let you know what I find out.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;

Mom picked up the line upstairs. What&#39;s shaking?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I was thinking about what you said today,&quot; you say, your heart pounding. &quot;About trying to make out. And about seeing if anything happens. You know. To me. D&#39;you want to?&quot; It comes blurting out more awkwardly than you could have imagined.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Me?&quot; $fr asks, perplexed.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Well, yeah,&quot; you say. It&#39;s a good thing he can&#39;t see how red you&#39;re turning. &quot;I mean, you&#39;re a boy, still, and I&#39;m ...

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Hmm,&quot; $fr says, thinking it over. &quot;Sure, I guess so. I probably ... I mean, it&#39;s not like ...&quot; He stops. &quot;Where were you thinking? Maybe ... you want to go to dinner? And then the park? Lots of couples make out over there. Nobody would notice. Maybe tomorrow night?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Sure,&quot; you say. For some reason, it sounds deeply exciting. Naughty. Dangerous. You start to get a funny feeling in the pit of your stomach — no, lower than that. Kissing $fr on the lips. In the park. &quot;Tomorrow night? Sure.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Oh, there&#39;s one thing,&quot; he adds. &quot;You&#39;re going to have to dress like a girl. Otherwise it&#39;ll look funny, y&#39;know?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;elseif $startsex == &quot;female&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Hey,&quot; you say. &quot;It&#39;s good to talk to you.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Her response is a little puzzled. &quot;It&#39;s good to talk to you, too. What&#39;s up?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I was thinking about what you said earlier,&quot; you stammer. &quot;About trying it again, to see if anything happens. I think it&#39;s a good idea. What do you say to you and me going down to the park and trying it out a little?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;You and me?&quot; $fr asks, interested. She lowers her voice to a whisper. &quot;Do you mean ... making out?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Well, yeah,&quot; you reply. The idea is very intriguing. You&#39;ve never made out with a girl before, and $fr is your best friend. Why not?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Just like that?&quot; $fr asks. &quot;I thought you had a boyfriend. You&#39;ve been writing letters to me about him all summer.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I just figured he wouldn&#39;t want to do it,&quot; you explain. &lt;&lt;if $openzeta == true&gt;&gt;&quot;He was a bit surprised when I showed up in band class.&quot;&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;&quot;I haven&#39;t really told him yet, anyway.&quot;&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Why me?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I thought if I should be making out with any girl, it should be you,&quot; you say. &quot;You know, for my first time.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;That&#39;s sweet,&quot; $fr says. &quot;All right. Pick me up tomorrow night. We&#39;ll go to the park. And dress like a boy, okay? I don&#39;t want anyone thinking we&#39;re two //girls// smooching behind the statues. A girl could get a reputation that way.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Are you trying to make me feel better or worse?&quot; you ask. &quot;Just try to keep your hat on, all right? After tonight, if this works, it&#39;ll all go back the way it was.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;After dinner, you take a walk to the park, and $fr holds your hand. Her fingers seem tiny in your grip.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;You could //try,//&quot; $fr says, &quot;and I wish you would.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Eventually, you make it to the riverbank. There are some footpaths here, and a few logs that have been worn down by a generation of people sitting on them and taking in the evening. You sit down, and $fr crowds up close so you have to put your arm around her. She leans up against you, dropping one little hand on your thigh. You can smell something floral in her hair, which seems suddenly exotic and unusual. //You// used to smell like that. Now you have a good idea why girls do it.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;You&#39;re trembling,&quot; you say. &quot;Are you cold? Do you need my jacket?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Me neither,&quot; you say, and you start to draw her in with your arm. &quot;Let&#39;s not think about it.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Then she&#39;s in your arms, and her face is close, and you&#39;re searching for her lips with yours. She lets you kiss her, and hangs limply in your embrace, her breath coming faster and faster. $fr&#39;s hands clutch at your back. Your heart is pounding. The taste of your best friend&#39;s lips is divine.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;As you kiss her — her lips, her cheeks, roaming to the hollow of her throat, then up to just below her ear — you can feel your cock coming to life in your trousers. It&#39;s trying to break free of the fabric that contains it, throbbing, pushing, straining. Your cock is powerful and it //wants// something. You aren&#39;t even sure what, but just now you can&#39;t even remember what it was like being a girl.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Hold on, Romeo, I&#39;m getting too hot,&quot; $fr says, her breath labored, as she pushes gently back. She&#39;s flushed and smiling. &quot;Is it working?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Boy, is it ever,&quot; you mutter. You want another kiss.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Is it ... getting hard?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Are you trying to make me feel better or worse?&quot; you ask. &quot;Just try to keep your hat on, all right? After tonight, if this works, it&#39;ll all go back the way it was.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;

There are some footpaths here, and a few logs that have been worn down by a generation of people sitting on them and taking in the evening. $fr sits down, and you crowd up close so he has to put his arm around your shoulders. You lean up against him, dropping one little hand on his thigh. You can smell something musky and spicy, which seems suddenly exotic and unusual. //You// used to smell like that. Now you have a good idea why boys do it.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;You&#39;re trembling,&quot; he says. &quot;Are you cold? Do you need my jacket?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I&#39;m just nervous,&quot; you say, giving him a weak little smile. &quot;I can&#39;t believe we&#39;re doing this.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Me neither,&quot; he says, and before you know it, his strong arms are drawing you in, and he says, &quot;Let&#39;s not think about it.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Then he&#39;s folding you in his arms, and his face is close, and he&#39;s searching for your lips with his. His kisses feed a growing warmth inside your belly that makes you feel limp and helpless, and you feel yourself go passive in his embrace, your breath coming faster and faster. Your tiny hands clutch at his back, and your heart is pounding. The taste of your best friend&#39;s lips is divine.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;As he kisses you — your lips, your cheeks, roaming to the hollow of your throat, then up to just below your ear, where you can feel his hot breath — you can feel your panties growing hot and damp beneath your dress. You want to slide your thighs together, to create some rubbing, to satisfy that empty //hunger// down there. You aren&#39;t even sure what your body needs, but just now you can&#39;t even remember what it was like being a boy.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Hold on, Romeo, I&#39;m getting too hot,&quot; you say through your labored breaths, and you push him gently back.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;He looks into your eyes. &quot;Is it working?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;It&#39;s working,&quot; you say, putting one hand modestly to your throat. &quot;It&#39;s //really// working. How about you? Are you ... getting hard?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I passed //hard// a long time ago.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I don&#39;t think I&#39;m hard,&quot; you say, glancing down. &quot;I&#39;m not sure //what// I am. But I feel ... ready. Does that make sense?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;You&#39;re the girl, you tell me.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You smile at him. &quot;Should we keep going?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;$fr grins. &quot;I&#39;m game if you are.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;&lt;if $page == 8&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;if $sex == &quot;male&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You and $fr retreat into the bushes, hearts pounding, trying to keep the branches from rustling too much. You unzip her skirt and push it down her hips, and she helps you unzip your trousers. Her eyes light up when she sees the straining bulge beneath your underwear.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;$fr giggles as she untucks your proud penis, holding the hot shaft in her tiny hand. &quot;It doesn&#39;t look like Hester Mulholland&#39;s drawing //at all,//&quot; she says, &quot;but I //like// it.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Neither of you has ever done this before — obviously — but you reckon that for your very first time, you and $fr manage to please each other pretty well. $fr is good with her hands, stroking your cock with a dainty, tentative grip and a steady rhythmic pace. You can tell she&#39;s watching your face, because every time you seem to get close to exploding, she backs off and prolongs the anticipation. Finally, you feel like you&#39;re going to have to explode, and you push her back, panting.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Was that good?&quot; $fr asks innocently.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Oh, yeah. Where&#39;d you learn to do that?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;In Home Ec class with Barbara Cotton and a banana,&quot; $fr grins.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You want to give $fr the same pleasure, so you reach into her panties to find a definite dampness there, and you slip two fingers inside her, sliding them in and out, while putting light pressure beside her clitoris with your thumb. $fr&#39;s eyes open wide, and her lips turn into an O of pleasure, and the only way to keep her from crying out loud is to kiss her again.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;In time, when you feel like you can&#39;t hold off the demands of your cock any longer, you force down her skirt and her panties and roll over on top of her. She takes your cock in hand and guides it in, and you start to thrust deep within her. $fr is warm and wet inside, and there&#39;s a delicious slippery sensation swallowing you up. You can hear $fr saying something, but words fail you and you can&#39;t concentrate on a reply.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Just as you feel you can&#39;t hold off a minute longer, and your cock is about to explode inside her, your mind seems to crack, and your body begins to burn. Your flesh feels like it&#39;s being //stretched//, your bones tremble, your teeth rattle in your jaw, your skin seems electrified, and then ...&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Your throbbing erection is gone. Gone completely.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Through the chill of sweat on your skin, and the quivering remains of your moments of orgasm with $fr, you realize: you&#39;re a girl again.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Your legs are a little shorter. Your hands are a bit smaller. Your shoes fit a little better — they&#39;re even a little loose. And, somehow, your breasts are bigger than they were before.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;//What a way to make your bustline develop,// you think. //It&#39;s much better than any lotion or exercise I ever heard of. But somehow I don&#39;t think it&#39;ll catch on.//&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Are you okay?&quot; $fr asks. &lt;&lt;if $hair gt 5&gt;&gt;&quot;Hey, your hair grew back a little.&quot;&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;&quot;You look ... different.&quot;&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I guess it worked,&quot; you say. You can&#39;t decide if you&#39;re relieved or disappointed.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Holy cow, I&#39;d say it did,&quot; $fr says, looking down between your legs. &quot;Aw, it&#39;s gone.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You roll away from her. &quot;Yeah, it sure is,&quot; you say, repeating the obvious. &quot;It&#39;s gone.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Well!&quot; $fr says happily. &quot;Don&#39;t that beat all.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Well, you&#39;re right. It worked. Thank you.&quot; You give $fr another kiss, then you creep down to the river to wash up a little. Everything has to be in its place when you return home, or your parents will notice something awry.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;&lt;elseif $sex == &quot;female&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You and $fr retreat into the bushes, hearts pounding, trying to keep the branches from rustling too much. You unzip your trousers, showing him the embarrassing absence in your underwear where your manhood used to be.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Holy moley, it&#39;s true,&quot; $fr says, amazed. &quot;Man, you really //did// turn into a girl.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I told you,&quot; you say. &quot;Now you.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Then he unzips his trousers to show you his manhood, which is fully erect. It&#39;s only the second penis you&#39;ve ever seen, after your own. It&#39;s a little bigger than yours was, and you can&#39;t decide if that makes you jealous or hungry.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You&#39;ve never done this before — obviously — but you reckon that for your very first time, you and $fr manage to please each other pretty well. Not knowing where else to begin, you take $fr&#39;s cock in your hands and show him your favorite stroke for masturbating: a light grip, a steady motion, and backing off the pace when you can see he&#39;s about to explode. You try to make your handjob last quite a long time, something you&#39;re expert in. Finally, he has to push you away and catch his breath.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Then he shows you something he&#39;s learned that you&#39;ve never heard of before. He lays his head between your thighs and starts to probe at your pussy with his tongue. You&#39;re too surprised to cry out when his questing tongue finds that little magic button near the apex and starts drawing circles and arcs around it, this way and that, and then you feel two fingers part your pussy and slip into you. You bite your lip and clamp your eyes shut, not daring to make a sound.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;In time, when you feel your pleasure can&#39;t go on any further, he heaves himself up toward your head and starts kissing you again, and you can feel him fumbling with one hand to find your pussy with the tip of his cock. You have to take him in hand and guide him home, and then he&#39;s pushing //all// the way in, filling you up completely. You didn&#39;t even realize you had that much //space// down there, but you do, and now it&#39;s full of your best friend&#39;s cock. He&#39;s grunting quietly with every stroke, his eyes closed, and you can&#39;t help but watch the blissful expressions on his face. You feel the same way inside. Then his face contorts, and you can tell he&#39;s close — and he bursts inside of you, as he grits his teeth and his whole body quavers.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Then your mind seems to crack, and your body begins to burn. Your flesh feels like it&#39;s being //squeezed//, your bones tremble, your teeth rattle in your jaw, your skin seems electrified, and then ...&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;The feeling of being //full// is suddenly gone, and $fr is lying beside you, breathing hard.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Through the chill of sweat on your skin, and the quivering remains of your moments of encounter with $fr, you realize: you&#39;re a boy again.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Your legs are a little longer. Your hands are a bit bigger. Your shoes don&#39;t fit — they have become a little too tight. And your cock is back where it always used to be. It might even be sightly bigger than before.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;//I bet a lot of guys would kill for that little secret,// you think. //But somehow I don&#39;t think it&#39;ll catch on.//&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Are you okay?&quot; $fr asks. &quot;You look ... different.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I guess it worked,&quot; you say. You can&#39;t decide if you&#39;re relieved or disappointed.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Holy cow, I&#39;d say it did,&quot; $fr says, looking down between your legs. &quot;Hey, you got your dick back! That&#39;s keen.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Instinctively, you want to cover yourself up, but there almost doesn&#39;t seem to be a point. &quot;Yes, it is,&quot; you say, repeating the obvious. &quot;It&#39;s back.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Well!&quot; $fr says happily. &quot;Hot dog! We did it!&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Well, you&#39;re right. It worked. Thank you.&quot; You give $fr another kiss, then you creep down to the river to wash up a little. Everything has to be in its place when you return home, or your parents will notice something awry.&lt;/div&gt;

They consider close contact between boys and girls to be extremely unhygienic. And wherever place you find, it has to be close. Lunch is almost over.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Fortunately, you find a nice quiet place behind the backstop of the baseball field. The season is over and there&#39;s nobody out here playing. Gym classes are all indoors doing swimming. And behind the backstop is a line of trees. You&#39;re protected from view in two directions.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&lt;&lt;if $fgen == 4&gt;&gt;&quot;I can&#39;t believe we&#39;re doing this,&quot; $fr says, flushed and pink-faced. &quot;Isn&#39;t it exciting?&quot;&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;&quot;This is going to be wicked,&quot; $fr says, grinning. &quot;Aren&#39;t you excited?&quot;&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;It&#39;s a little strange, don&#39;t you think?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Don&#39;t worry,&quot; $fr promises, reaching for you. &quot;I won&#39;t tell anybody if you&#39;re a bad kisser.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;

She isn&#39;t sure whether she should try to fight you off or lean in.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;he&#39;s pressing you up against the backstop, towering over you, kissing you, his hands roaming up the side of your body toward your chest. You aren&#39;t sure whether you should fight off his wandering hands or let him have his way with you.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Your pulse races. Your heart pounds. You can feel a dizzying heat building up inside you.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;newspaper&quot;&gt;A student is attending Renton Comprehensive this September with a strange new medical condition: sometimes &lt;&lt;if $startsex == &quot;male&quot;&gt;&gt;he&#39;s a boy, and at other times, a girl.

Without knowing what else to do, $nom[$soppgen] got dressed and came to school for the first day of class. Some of you may have even seen $acc[$soppgen].&lt;/div&gt;&lt;&lt;set $path.push(&quot;other zetas&quot;)&gt;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;newspaper&quot;&gt;With the kind permission of Mr Fordyce, our principal, _name has continued to come to class, despite the newness of this bizarre and peculiar new condition, although $nom[$soppgen] has had to make a few changes.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;newspaper&quot;&gt;&quot;I had to borrow a lot of clothes,&quot; $nom[$soppgen] says. &quot;My mother talked to some other mothers in the PTA.&quot; Without the generosity of the other parents, _name says $nom[$soppgen] would not have been able to meet the school dress code. &lt;&lt;if $startsex == &quot;male&quot;&gt;&gt;Be sure to keep those skirts below the knee, $name!&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;Be sure to tie that necktie nice and square, $name!&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;newspaper&quot;&gt;The exact nature of _name&#39;s medical condition is not yet known. Research among local physicians shows there are a number of patients in the Puget Sound area with a similar condition, which is being called Dimorphic Zeta Chromosome Syndrome. It is not yet known how many of them attend Renton Comprehensive, but according to rumor the number may be as high as &lt;&lt;if $path.includes(&quot;known zeta&quot;)&gt;&gt;three&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;two&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;The article is on the third page, in the Features section. It reads:&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;newspaper&quot;&gt;&#39;&#39;NEW CONDITION FOUND AT RCHS&#39;&#39;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;newspaper&quot;&gt;A strange new medical condition that causes &lt;&lt;if $startsex == &quot;male&quot;&gt;&gt;boys to become girls&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;girls to become boys&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; has been discovered right in our very own Renton Comprehensive High School.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;newspaper&quot;&gt;Mr Fordyce, the principal of RCHS, confirms that at least &lt;&lt;if $path.includes(&quot;known zeta&quot;)&gt;&gt;three&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;two&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; students at our school have been identified as having this new medical condition, which is previously unknown to science. According to rumor around the school, the number may be even higher!&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;newspaper&quot;&gt;The staff of the &quot;Aerie&quot; has been unable to identify any of these students on the record, but rest assured, fellow Golden Eagles: they&#39;re out there.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;newspaper&quot;&gt;One local physician, Dr Malcolm Heard, said he was personally aware of several cases of Dimorphic Zeta Chromosome Syndrome, but due to his Hippocratic Oath he was unable to reveal their names, or which high schools they attended.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;newspaper&quot;&gt;When asked if this condition posed a danger to the public, Dr Heard said more research would be needed.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;newspaper&quot;&gt;The Zeta Chromosome condition has been traced to an experimental polio vaccine that was produced in the 1930s by the University of Washington, which some parents of Renton Comprehensive students may have participated in. If you turn into a girl or a boy tomorrow, blame your old man!&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;newspaper&quot;&gt;According to Dr Heard, the condition appears to lie dormant for many years until it &quot;awakens,&quot; in his words, in the person&#39;s teenage years. This means there could be many more victims out there that don&#39;t even know who they are.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;newspaper&quot;&gt;Meanwhile, the number of identified Dimorphic Zetas continues to grow in the Puget Sound area. Keep your eyes open, fellow Eagles! The next victim of this queer new contition might be sitting next to you!&lt;/div&gt;&lt;&lt;set $path.push(&quot;other zetas&quot;)&gt;&gt;

From 1930 to 1938, a researcher named Horace Kind attempted to produce a polio vaccine, using as test subjects a number of high school students in the area of King County, Washington. These experiments were ultimately unsuccessful in preventing polio, but they had an unexpected side effect. The children of those vaccine test subjects were born with a new kind of dimorphic sex chromosome, designated Z or Zeta.

The Zeta chromosome can transform its shape and chemical nature from X to Y and back, changing an XX into an XY pair, or vice-versa. It rarely does so when this would result in a non-viable combination, such as YY, although this is mostly because I (the author) don&#39;t want to complicate things unnecessarily. Some other author who is better versed in genetics can tackle this variation.

What the Zeta chromosome actually _does_ apart from change biological sex is up to the player. The intention is to permit the player to play through each of the scenarios and keep track of the player&#39;s decisions. The changes wrought by the Zeta chromosome and the way these affect society depend on what the player chooses.

THE CHOICES
There are five basic axes along which the player&#39;s choices matter. Major decisions from each story are added to the saved calculations, which persist across multiple playthroughs. (The player will have the option to wipe the history and start fresh.)

* Sex. Does the Zeta chromosome only affect AFAB or AMAB? If the player always selects &quot;male&quot; to start, then Zeta becomes a condition only of children born and identified as male at birth. The choice of starting character could become constrained to that single sex. If the player chooses a mixture of male and female starting points, the game will allow both AMAB and AFAB characters to be Zetas.

* Social. Does society accept or reject these changes? If the player is more open, more forthright, more bold, and more accepting of the changes, society will shift in that direction. Zetas will get more good publicity as role models emerge on early radio and newsreels, and later in the golden age of television. If the player is more secretive or shameful about these changes, and pushes less against the grain, then society will have a less-good view of Zetas; and Zetas of the future are more likely to conceal their natures or face consequences. The world thus becomes the kind of place that the player creates.

* Orientation. Does the Zeta chromosome change your orientation or sex drive? If the player chooses to engage in new sexual behaviors (for instance, going from hetero male to hetero female), then at least sometimes the Zeta chromosome makes this happen. If the player chooses to remain with one sexuality (eg, hetero male to lesbian female) then the Zeta chromosome is _not_ known for changing orientation. The game will keep track of how often this happens and make assumptions about later characters&#39; sexuality.

* Mental. Does the Zeta chromosome change the way people think? Is the brain itself altered, setting aside matters of orientation? Do Zetas think differently in each state?

* Procreation. Since a Zeta always changes during sex, it makes normal methods of proliferation for the Z chromosome impossible. Therefore, one of two methods must be favored. Either the chromosome is _transmissible_ (you can catch Zeta from somewhere), or the chromosome is _lockable_ (your form can be fixed in one state somehow, either temporarily or permanently).

All of the above contribute to the kind of world the player creates. If Zetas are looked down upon, and the state is Lockable, then Zetas may try to fix themselves in a favored shape. If Zetas are disfavored and the condition can be caught, then the condition might be inflicted on others out of spite, and transgender people may secretly aspire to catch the condition. And so on.

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Mrs Decker nods at you, smiling gently. &quot;Very good. Let me get your card and I&#39;ll show you which classes your mother asked to sign you up for.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;&lt;if $page == 1&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You go behind the counter. Mrs Decker folds the countertop back down behind you and leads over to her desk. There&#39;s a wooden chair with an uncomfortable slatted back beside her desk, and she directs you to sit.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;No, no, dear,&quot; she admonishes you, seeing the way you seat yourself. &lt;&lt;if $sex == &quot;female&quot;&gt;&gt;&quot;Knees together. And hook your ankles together. That&#39;s more ladyl—er, I mean,&quot; she says, hesitating, &quot;you should try to look ladylike.&quot;&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;&quot;Unbutton the blazer when you sit down, or it&#39;ll just look rumpled and untidy. That&#39;s how a gentleman would—I mean,&quot; she says, hesitating, &quot;now that you //are// one, you should try to look the part.&quot;&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;She turns her attention to some long typewritten forms that have been placed under the heavy glass surface of her desk. &quot;Here we are. First semester, 1948. Let&#39;s see...&quot; She compares the list to your hand-written student schedule card in her other hand.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You crane your neck to look.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Mrs Decker whips a pencil out from behind her ear and starts to make notes on your student card. &quot;Well, Mr $lastname — I mean Miss $lastname — er, $name. You know what I mean. How very confusing this is!&quot; She looks flustered. &quot;We&#39;ll have to change some of your classes around, but I think we can manage to devise a schedule for you that fits your current condition.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;She pushes your altered student card across the table. It&#39;s a half-sheet of thick cardstock with a pre-printed grid: classes down the left side, and space for grades across the middle.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;if $sex == &quot;female&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;We&#39;ll have to take you out of second period Gym class,&quot; she says, pointing at the card with her pencil. &quot;Normally, the state requries you to take some kind of physical fitness class, but there //are// alternatives. I&#39;ve written in Pep Squad for you, which is third period. That&#39;s one of the classes they allow us to use instead.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Pep Squad?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Oh, yes,&quot; she says. &quot;You&#39;ll love it. There&#39;s dance and choreography, and you do drills and routines with the marching band, you perform at the football games. It&#39;s very physical. A lot of girls your age—&quot; She falters. &quot;Well, anyway. It&#39;s co-ed, so there are some boys in the class too, but there&#39;s no worries about locker rooms or anything, so Mr Fordyce should approve.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Is there a uniform?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Not for every day, just for game days. Now, since Pep Squad is third period, we had to take you out of History and put you in second-period Stenography instead. That&#39;s for taking shorthand, which is very useful for young ladies to know.&quot; She shows you some squiggles on a steno pad. &quot;And your seventh-period class, Wood Shop, Mr Fordyce and $shop decided there might be too much lifting and carrying of wood and boards and so on, and you might prefer that we switch you into $homeec&#39;s Home Economics class.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I thought boys didn&#39;t have to take Home Economics.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Normally, no,&quot; Mrs Decker says apologetically, &quot;but it isn&#39;t just baking cookies and sewing dresses any more. There&#39;s some home repair, too. Knowing how to fix your home appliances. You&#39;ll like it. And there&#39;s those other home skills, too, and I think every girl should—&quot; She stops, with a polite but confused cough. &quot;At any rate, I think that will do nicely.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;

I&#39;ve written in Marching Band for you, which is secnd period. That&#39;s one of the classes they allow us to use instead.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Marching Band?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Oh, yes,&quot; she says. &quot;You&#39;ll love it. The band has a drum corps, and they&#39;re always looking for boys—&quot; She falters. &quot;Well, anyway. It&#39;s co-ed, so there are some girls in the class too, but there&#39;s no worries about locker rooms or anything, so Mr Fordyce should approve.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Is there a uniform?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Not for every day, just for game days. Now, since Marching Band is second period, we had to take you out of Stenography and put you in third-period History instead. $hist is a very good instructor, and he teaches a lot of military history, which a lot of the boys in his class seem to like.&quot; She goes down the list. &quot;And your seventh-period Home Economics course, well, $homeec thought you might be a distraction to the girls in there, so we&#39;ve decided you&#39;d do better in Wood Shop with $shop.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I thought girls weren&#39;t allowed to take Wood Shop.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Oh, they are,&quot; Mrs Decker says breezily, &quot;it just doesn&#39;t happen very often. Most young ladies don&#39;t grow up to be carpenters, you see. That&#39;s more of a job for young men like you, who—&quot; She stops, with a polite but confused cough. &quot;At any rate, I think that will do nicely.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;She pushes your altered student card across the table. It&#39;s a half-sheet of thick cardstock with a pre-printed grid: classes down the left side, and space for grades across the middle.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;if $sex == &quot;male&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Take a look,&quot; she says, turning it around so you can read it. As you peruse the handwritten list, she copies the classes onto a piece of steno paper for you. &quot;First period English, second period gymnasium. The first four weeks will be swimming. Third period, history with $hist. He&#39;s very good. $hist teaches a lot of military history, which you should like. Then Vocal Music, fourth period, and then lunch. The cafeteria is just up those steps you see outside, through the doors, turn right at the trophy cabinet, and left through the commons. Ask one of the other boys, they&#39;ll be able to tell you the right way to go.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;After lunch, you&#39;ll have Spanish. Then sixth-period Geometry, and finally Wood Shop. A lot of young men these days are going into building, so you&#39;ll learn some useful skills there, I&#39;m sure.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;elseif $sex == &quot;female&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Take a look,&quot; she says, turning it around so you can read it. As you peruse the handwritten list, she copies the classes onto a piece of steno paper for you. &quot;First period English, second period Stenography. That&#39;s a very useful course for young ladies, for taking fast notes and so on. Then third period Gym, and the girls are starting swimming for the first four weeks. After Gym you&#39;ll go to Vocal Music, then lunch. The cafeteria is through the big green front doors just outside. Follow the pretty green tiles in the floor, then keep going until you smell the cafeteria. If you have trouble, one of the other girls will be happy to show you the way.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;After lunch, you&#39;ll have Spanish. Then sixth-period Bookkeeping, and finally Home Economics. $homeec is very good, and she teaches a lot about repairing home appliances, in addition to the usual lessons on baking and sewing.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;\
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Thanks, ma&#39;am,&quot; you say, taking the sheet of steno paper.&lt;/div&gt;

The school secretary, Mrs Decker, rises from her desk with a flustered look. &quot;Earlyse!&quot; she cries. &quot;What&#39;s this? A boy -- wait, isn&#39;t that --&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Buzz Gabe,&quot; $pep says sternly. &quot;And call the staff nurse. I&#39;ve got to get back to class. This one&#39;s got Zeta Syndrome. A pretty bad case, I&#39;d say.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Mrs Decker puts her silk scarf up over her nose and mouth. Over the top of the scarf, her eyes are huge. &quot;Right away,&quot; she says, muffled, and presses a desk intercom. A distant buzzing sounds. &quot;Gabe, get out here right away. We&#39;ve got another student with Zeta in the office.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Be there in a minute,&quot; a voice crackles back.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;$pep regards your altered physique with a frown. &quot;I think it goes without saying that we can&#39;t have you on the Pep Squad in this condition,&quot; she says. &quot;I&#39;m not saying I couldn&#39;t //use// two boys on the squad, but I need to be able to plan our routines, and I //don&#39;t// want what just happened, happening again during a performance.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I can&#39;t go back to gym class like this, can I?&quot; you ask. &quot;Please don&#39;t make me do that. The girls would laugh.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;No, that&#39;s true,&quot; $pep says thoughtfully. &quot;We can&#39;t have you in your gym class looking like //this.// There would be a riot.&quot; The corners of her mouth twitch in amusement. &quot;There&#39;s a Health and Hygiene class, but Mrs Whitmire shows ... er, certain films to the girls, so I don&#39;t think you&#39;d fit in there either. Frankly, I don&#39;t think there //is// a class for you.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Mr Fordyce, the principal, arrives. He&#39;s polishing his silver spectacles on the end of his tie. &quot;Another Zeta, Irma? We do seem to be finding a lot of them since that article got printed. I told you it was a bad idea to let them run that story.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Gabriel, I have to take $name out of Pep,&quot; $pep says in a brisk voice. &quot;I can&#39;t have this happening to any of my other girls. Do you know anywhere else we can put her?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I&#39;ve talked to the state, and we can waive the Phys Ed requirements if the student is on an athletic team,&quot; the principal says. He doesn&#39;t bother looking you over; he&#39;s seen this before. &quot;I think we give him to $geom and put him on the wrestling team for now.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Wrestling isn&#39;t a class,&quot; $pep says.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;No, you&#39;re right. He&#39;ll have to go to the meetings after school. During class time, Mr $lastname can lift weights, I suppose. Put it down as independent study.&quot; For the first time, the principal glances at you. &quot;Are you doing okay? You don&#39;t look very surprised.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;No, it&#39;s ... happened before,&quot; you admit.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I thought as much. Well,&quot; he sighs, turning back to $pep and Mrs Decker. &quot;Fetch the nurse, although I don&#39;t really see why. Confirm this case and get it in the record, but for God&#39;s sake, try to keep a lid on it.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;When the principal has gone, $pep leaves for class and Mrs Decker invites you to her desk to adjust your schedule.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Where do I go now?&quot; you ask.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;You can&#39;t go anywhere wearing //that.// I&#39;m going to call your mother and have her bring in a change of clothes,&quot; the secretary says. &quot;After that, you&#39;re going back to class.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;

The school secretary, Mrs Decker, rises from her desk with a flustered look. &quot;Oscar!&quot; she cries. &quot;What&#39;s this? A girl -- wait, isn&#39;t that --&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Yes, I&#39;m afraid so,&quot; $band says. &quot;My first case of Zeta. Looks like a bad one, I&#39;m guessing.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Mrs Decker puts her silk scarf up over her nose and mouth. Over the top of the scarf, her eyes are huge. &quot;Let me get Gabe. And the nurse, too,&quot; she adds in a muffled voice. She presses a desk intercom. A distant buzzing sounds. &quot;Gabe, get out here right away. We&#39;ve got another student with Zeta in the office.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Be there in a minute,&quot; a voice crackles back.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;$band frowns at your suddenly altered physique. &quot;I don&#39;t think I need to explain that I&#39;m not going to keep you on the band,&quot; he says. &quot;I can&#39;t have one of my bass drummers suddenly fall down on parade like you did just now in class. I //certainly// don&#39;t want anybody else catching this from you.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I can&#39;t go back to gym class like this, can I?&quot; you ask. &quot;Please don&#39;t make me do that. The boys would laugh.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Oh, no no no, we&#39;re not doing //that,//&quot; $band says. &quot;No. That wouldn&#39;t do. A girl in a boy&#39;s gym class? Never.&quot; He considers the matter for a moment. &quot;There&#39;s always Health and Hygiene, but it&#39;s usually full by now. I&#39;m not sure what class you //can// take, in your condition.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Mr Fordyce, the principal, arrives. He&#39;s polishing his silver spectacles on the end of his tie. &quot;Another Zeta, Irma? We do seem to be finding a lot of them since that article got printed. I told you it was a bad idea to let them run that story.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;What do you think, Gabe?&quot; $band asks. &quot;Is this a case of Zeta? I thought so. Better take him out of Marching Band and give him something else to do.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Yes, but what?&quot; the principal asks. He doesn&#39;t bother looking you over; he&#39;s seen this before. &quot;I&#39;ve talked to the state, and we can waive the Phys Ed requirements if the student is on an athletic team. I don&#39;t see what else we can do.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;The band could use another majorette,&quot; $band says. &quot;We can get him a skirt and a baton, and he could meet with the other girls. I mean ... the girls.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;And what will Miss $lastname do during class time?&quot; Mr Fordyce asks. &quot;I suppose she could always do calisthenics in the weight room. We can put it down as independent study.&quot; For the first time, the principal glances at you. &quot;Are you doing okay? You don&#39;t look very surprised.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;

		with CROSS: new identity for the current (eg, opposite) sex
		no CROSS: old identity for the starting sex
		
	SECRET GIRL and BOY schedules mean the school is not aware, but

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;The teacher, $band, a stout red-faced man with a thick mustache, speaks to you privately before class. &quot;I understand, Mr $lastname, that you are new to the band this year, and are switching over from Gym class. Is that right?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Yes, sir,&quot; you say.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Now I&#39;ve heard from Mr Fordyce that you have a ... a condition that prevents you from taking Gym,&quot; he goes on, &quot;but that doesn&#39;t mean you have a right to play in the band. I have to sign off on your performance. If I find you are simply here to skip Gym, I won&#39;t sign your transfer and you&#39;ll be back in the locker room. You&#39;ll have to find something else.

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Good. Now I&#39;m going to start you on the bass drum to begin with. We have a spare that belongs to the school. Do you read music?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;A little. I&#39;ve been taking Vocal Music for a few years.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Good. It shouldn&#39;t be hard for you to follow along. Let&#39;s see how you do with the bass drum for a few weeks, and if you show some rhythm and aptitude, we can try you on a snare drum.&quot;&lt;/div&gt; 
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Marvin Long, the other bass drummer in the marching band, helps you strap on the big bass drum, adjusting the straps for you. &quot;You&#39;ll want it to be comfortable,&quot; he says. &quot;It can get tiresome to carry around after a while, so make sure it fits you.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Yeah, yeah, I can understand that. Good,&quot; he adds, more to himself. &quot;Okay, then I&#39;ll see you tonight?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;There&#39;s an unspoken question in there, which you decide to answer. &quot;It&#39;s still going,&quot; you say firmly. &quot;Same as before.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;He nods miserably. &quot;Look, I&#39;m sorry I flipped out a little yesterday. I didn&#39;t know what else to say.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;We&#39;ll have to talk later.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;We were supposed to talk last night.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Yeah, that&#39;s cool,&quot; he says, his attention wandering back to the brass and woodwind musicians oomphing away in two-four time. &quot;Well, I guess I&#39;d better get back.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;You probably should.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Maybe I could call you? Some time this weekend, maybe?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;\
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Then $music calls your name, and you have to go get measured. &quot;Yeah. Talk to you later!&quot; you say.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Yeah, sure,&quot; $so says, and returns to band practice.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;&lt;if $path.includes(&quot;sock stuffing&quot;)&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You&#39;re the first one to get measured, and you&#39;re discreetly trying to adjust your trousers so everything looks normal. These trousers are a little snug around the crotch, and your sock stuffing isn&#39;t holding in place. Then there&#39;s an ominous twang and a little whipping sensation against your inner thigh, and you can feel your makeshift penis slipping down your trouser leg.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Ron Zimmerman, the saxophonist, looks down at the sock falling out of your trouser leg. &quot;What&#39;s that?&quot; he asks.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Then Gerald Myers, the red-headed class clown, notices the sock sitting on your loafer and makes the connection. &quot;Oh, shit!&quot; he exclaims loudly, pointing. &quot;$name stuffs his pants!&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You&#39;re the first one to get measured, and you&#39;re discreetly trying to adjust your trousers so everything looks normal. These trousers are a little snug around the crotch, and there&#39;s no mistaking the absence of any male equipment down there. Why didn&#39;t you stuff your trousers?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Underwear too tight?&quot; asks Ron Zimmerman, the saxophonist. &quot;I hate that.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Yeah,&quot; jokes Gerald Myers. He&#39;s a red-headed class clown who thinks he&#39;s much funnier than he really is. &quot;It&#39;s so tight you can see his—&quot; But he stops and stares. &quot;Shit, you can&#39;t even see his balls!&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;\
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;The loud cry and the shocking expletive make half the people in the band turn to look. &quot;Language!&quot; calls $music, and $band angrily taps his baton for tempo.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;What&#39;s the matter, didn&#39;t your balls drop yet?&quot; Gerald jokes. &quot;Because you don&#39;t seem to be packing any.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Quit staring at his dick, you pervert!&quot; Ronald says, to which Gerald replies &quot;//What// dick?&quot; and $music says &quot;Language, I said!&quot; again.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Then $music has come around the table and grabbed both of them by the ear. &quot;All right, you two, come with me,&quot; she says. Her usual demeanor of frazzled, good-natured charm has vanished, and she looks angry. &quot;We&#39;re going to see Mr Fordyce and tell him about your potty mouths.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Great. There&#39;s no way Gerald will keep his big mouth shut. Now it&#39;ll be all over the whole school.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Next Friday, the twenty-fourth, is our first football game. Attendance for all band members is mandatory.

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I don&#39;t know, sir,&quot; you answer truthfully. &quot;It might happen. The doctor says it&#39;s going to happen a lot during the first month.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;All right,&quot; he grumbles. &quot;Head over to $music&#39;s office before Wednesday and get measured for a skirt. You might just need one.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;It&#39;s two-and-//three//-four,&quot; $band says sternly, looking up toward the percussion section.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;But you can&#39;t put it out of your mind. You find yourself looking at the other students in the band. &lt;&lt;if $sex == &quot;male&quot; and $mlikesboys gte 0&gt;&gt;That trumpeter there, he&#39;s pretty handsome. Nice cheekbokes. Tall.&lt;&lt;elseif $sex == &quot;female&quot; and $flikesboys gte 0&gt;&gt;That trumpeter there, he&#39;s pretty handsome. Nice cheekbokes. Tall.&lt;&lt;elseif $sex == &quot;male&quot; and $mlikesgirls gte 0&gt;&gt;That girl over there with the flute. She&#39;s got nice lips. Petite. Pretty.&lt;&lt;elseif $sex == &quot;female&quot; and $flikesgirls gte 0&gt;&gt;That girl over there with the flute. She&#39;s got nice lips. Petite. Pretty.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;So many handsome faces, so many pretty girls. Such a wealth of attractive students.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; No, you can&#39;t think about that right now.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You can&#39;t stop. The heat keeps growing inside you. Building. Inevitable. Sweat breaks out on your brow.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;The song drags on forever. The brasses are making you go slightly deaf in one ear. &lt;&lt;if $openzeta == true&gt;&gt;You really wish you could escape to the bathroom and change when nobody was watching. A piano practice room, maybe, that would work.&lt;&lt;elseif $sex == $startsex&gt;&gt;You really need to get to the bathroom. Like right //now.// Before you suddenly transform into a girl, right in front of everybody. You&#39;re dressed as a boy, but you&#39;re not prepared to have to hide a girl&#39;s body under these clothes.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;You wish you could escape to the bathroom and change when nobody was looking. You&#39;re dressed as a boy, dressed to hide your feminine shape. Maybe ... they won&#39;t notice. Maybe.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You catch the attention of the conductor and contrive, just by making a face and pointing toward yourself and the door, that you&#39;re not feeling well. He frowns at you, but he nods assent and mouths the word //go.//&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You set down your bass drum and bolt for the hallway. Once you&#39;re outside, it&#39;s a mad dash to the bathroom. Transforming in a bathroom isn&#39;t the best idea, but you figure you can lock yourself in one of the stalls for some privacy.&lt;/div&gt;
--&lt;&lt;link &quot;run to the bathroom&quot; &quot;1948 Solo&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;set $page to 11&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;/link&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;display &quot;SexSwitch&quot;&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Apparently you pass muster, because when $band is giving out notes to the various sections, the only thing he has to say to the percussion section is &quot;Louder. Much louder.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Looks like that means you&#39;re still in the band. That&#39;s a big relief.&lt;/div&gt;

In impulse, you stop one of the girls leaving Stenography and ask. It&#39;s one of the Morris triplets: Jean or Jane or June, you can&#39;t tell which. &quot;Excuse me, do you know where the Pep Squad meets?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Oh, sure,&quot; she says happily. &quot;Follow me!&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;It turns out the pep squad meets in the gymnasium, where a number of bleachers had been unfolded from the wall. All the girls — and one boy — are sitting on the bleachers. The triplet who led you here, whichever one it was, joins her sisters on the lowest bench, where they huddle their heads and giggle about something.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;The class is under the instruction of a youthful, athletic woman named $pep, who is so slender and has such muscular calves that she practically floats on air when she walks. She&#39;s very lean and has a no-nonsense attitude.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Welcome to Pep Squad, ladies,&quot; she says briskly, adding, &quot;//and// gentleman. We have a cheer king on the squad, at last. The first one I&#39;ve seen since before the war. Well done. Thanks for joining us.&quot; She holds up her hands to still the sudden rush of tittering conversation. &quot;Girls, girls. Before 1939, cheerleaders were //all// men. Until the draft. They all went away to war, and that left open some space for we ladies to take over. Let&#39;s all be welcoming to Mr Bailey, shall we?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Floyd Bailey essayed a little wave from the front row of the bleachers.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Now as I&#39;m sure you know,&quot; $pep goes on, &quot;this is a substitute for your regular Gym class, but it is not open to any and all. There isn&#39;t the space. Instead, I will be evaluating each of you during the first few weeks of class for enthusiasm, ability, balance, poise, and participation. Those of you who do not make the Pep Squad will have to go back to your regular physical education class, or find a new alternative. Is that clear to everyone?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Everybody nods, especially you. It&#39;s hard to imagine showing up in your regular Gym class and getting undressed in front of all the $girlsboys[$oppgen] there. You //can// imagine the teasing that would follow, however.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Excellent,&quot; $pep says. &quot;All right, I&#39;m going to go down my list. When you hear your name, call out &#39;present!&#39;&quot;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;&lt;set _lst to [$lastname, &quot;Lenford&quot;]&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;set _lst to _lst.sort()&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;if _lst[0] == $lastname&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;set _first to 0&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;set _first to 1&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;if $openzeta == true&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;set $path.push(&quot;SO informed&quot;)&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;set $path.delete(&quot;SO no contact&quot;)&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;set $fact.push(&quot;workout&quot;)&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;if _first == 0&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;As $pep calls out your name, you hear a squeal from the crowd of girls. &quot;My goodness,&quot; a voice says. &quot;$name? I didn&#39;t know //you// were doing Pep Squad this year!&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;elseif _first == 1&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;When $pep calls out &#39;$so Lenford&#39; you aren&#39;t really paying attention, but then she announces //your// name and there&#39;s a sudden squeal from the crowd of girls. &quot;My goodness,&quot; a voice says. &quot;$name? I didn&#39;t know //you// were doing Pep Squad this year!&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;\
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;But then $sonick //sees// you in your frilly blue dress and stockings and your yellow cardigan, and her mouth falls open. &quot;What are you doing?&quot; she asks in a scandalized voice. &quot;You&#39;re dressed like a — a —&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Oh!&quot; one of the Morris triplets, sitting right beside $so, tugs urgently at her hand. &quot;I forgot to tell you! $name is in Stenography with me. I should have said!&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;//Stenography?//&quot; $so asks blankly. &quot;Are you sure, Jean? That&#39;s for girls!&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I&#39;m sure,&quot; Jean says happily. &quot;We just came from there together.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Ladies, please,&quot; $pep says. &quot;I&#39;m taking roll. You can visit after class.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Oh, hey,&quot; says a girl in the front called Judith Young. &quot;Good to see you again! I didn&#39;t know you were doing Pep Squad this year.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;It&#39;s kind of a last-minute decision,&quot; you say weakly.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;\
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;$pep gets everybody on the gym floor doing warm-up stretches. She demonstrates each one at the front of the group, delivering stern warnings about what happens to girls who don&#39;t stretch properly before athletic activity. &quot;You could get hurt, so pay attention,&quot; she says. &quot;If you pull a muscle, you won&#39;t be able to perform at the games.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;It takes all of the first lesson to go over stretching exercises and safety rules. Since you&#39;re completely new to this, she takes special delight in correcting your form on the stretches. &quot;From now on, when you girls get to class, I want you to start right away on stretches. Don&#39;t wait for me. I want us to be ready to go as soon as possible, so we get the maximum amount of time.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;if $openzeta == true&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;After class, $so corners you, with the Morris triplets backing her up. &quot;How come you didn&#39;t tell me you were coming to class like this?&quot; she asks irritably.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I heard $nom[$oppgen] has some kind of condition,&quot; one of the triplets says from behind her.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Yes, June, me too,&quot; says another. &quot;It&#39;s so something new, the doctors don&#39;t even know what it is. You never know who it&#39;s going to be next!&quot; She looks gleefully wicked for a moment, then calms herself down. &quot;At least that&#39;s what Alice Whitfield told me.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;$so stares hard at you, torn between shock and sympathy. &quot;Is this true?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;More or less,&quot; you say. &quot;I woke up like this yesterday morning.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Yesterday //morning//?&quot; she demands. &lt;&lt;if $path.includes(&quot;shameful TG&quot;)&gt;&gt;&quot;Is that why you were out sick on the first day of school, when I //know// you weren&#39;t sick the night before?&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;&quot;Is that why you didn&#39;t come find me on the first day of school?&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; Why didn&#39;t you call me? You should have said something.&quot; She sticks her chin out at you stubbornly.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Yesterday was ... really a bad day,&quot; you say. &quot;I&#39;m so sorry, $so, I really am, but there was so much going on.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;All right, I suppose.&quot; She looks at you with lingering suspicion.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Maybe should talk about it later,&quot; you say. &quot;Call you tonight?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;At last, $so relents. She gives you a brief hug and a peck on the cheek. &quot;All right. Tonight, right after dinner?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;\
&lt;&lt;display &quot;NextClassLink&quot;&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;\
&lt;&lt;if $day == 4&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;After completing warm-ups for the day, $pep claps her hands. &quot;All right, most of you can probably guess what we&#39;re doing today. It&#39;s time to find a partner and get measured for uniforms, the same as every year. I have cloth tape measures here on this table! I have lists of measurements we need! If anybody doesn&#39;t know how to measure yourself, don&#39;t ask your neighbor -- ask me. We have to get the uniforms right for the first game and there&#39;s no time to send any back to the seamstress for adjustments.&quot; Over her shoulder, she says to &lt;&lt;if $sched == &quot;dickgirl schedule&quot;&gt;&gt;you and Floyd,&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;Floyd,&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; &quot;If you don&#39;t know how to measure an inseam, just let me do it. It&#39;ll be faster.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Can we change in the locker room?&quot; one of the girls asks. She&#39;s got on a bulky sweater and a floucy scarf.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;No, just change out here,&quot; the teacher says briskly. &quot;You don&#39;t have time to go all that way. When we&#39;re visiting another school, we may not have the luxury of changing in separate rooms, so you might as well get used to it. For now, just strip off that heavy sweater. Anything bulky you have on, take it off. You&#39;re not going to be wearing your uniform //over// your sweaters, girls.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Do we get //new// uniforms this year?&quot; asks one of the Morris triplets.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;No, Jean, I&#39;m afraid we&#39;re still using the ones from last year and making adjustments,&quot; $pep replies. &quot;All right, get together with your partners and come get a tape measure!&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;if $openzeta == true&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;set $fact.push(&quot;workout&quot;)&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You pair up with $so, bringing her a cloth tape measure and an extra sheet for her measurements.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;She gives you a long look before finally taking it out of your hand. &quot;Thanks.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;You&#39;re welcome.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Here, give me both of them, I&#39;ll put in our names.&quot; $so focuses on the worksheet for a few moments before speaking again. There&#39;s something bright and brittle about the way she&#39;s speaking, as if she&#39;s determined to maintain control of herself. &quot;There. Are you ready?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;if $path.includes(&quot;SO date&quot;)&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You can tell that something&#39;s wrong, so you say, &quot;I&#39;m sorry, I know this must be hard on you too.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Well, yes it is,&quot; $so says, and her brow furrows. &quot;A lot of girls are asking me if I&#39;m some kind of lezzie or something, and I don&#39;t even know what that //is.// I bet it&#39;s something unkind.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; you say again. &quot;I didn&#39;t mean for this to happen.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I know you didn&#39;t,&quot; she says, giving you a hug. &quot;If they think they&#39;re going to stop me being your girlfriend over a word like that, they&#39;re wrong. I&#39;m more determined than ever. We&#39;re going on that date, and I&#39;m kissing you, even if you //are// practically a girl right now. If there&#39;s a way to turn you back to normal, we&#39;ll find it.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;For a moment, you feel like you might choke up with tears. But you force a smile and say, &quot;Thanks, that means a lot to me right now.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Well, it is, yes,&quot; $so says, and she tries to clear her furrowed brow with a smile. &quot;Are you and $fr still ... doing that thing tonight?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Yes, as far as I know.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Good. I&#39;m glad. I hope it works.&quot; She touches your arm briefly, then draws it back. &quot;Anyway, I have some clothes for you that I can drop off right after school.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;For a moment, you feel like you might choke up with tears. But you force a smile and say, &quot;That will be very helpful. Thanks for being so understanding.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Well, it is, yes,&quot; $so says, and she tries to clear her furrowed brow with a smile. &quot;Do you still want me to bring some clothes over for you?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Yes, please,&quot; you say.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;All right, then. I will.&quot; She touches your arm briefly, then draws it back. &quot;I&#39;ll just drop them off right after school. You&#39;ll be home then, right?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Yes, I will.&quot; For a moment, you feel like you might choke up with tears. But you force a smile and say, &quot;That will be very helpful. Thanks for being so understanding.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Well, it is, yes,&quot; $so says, and she tries to clear her furrowed brow with a smile. &quot;I should try to be more understanding. I don&#39;t think this is what you //wanted,// exactly.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You pull your knit sweater off over your head, feeling how snug it is around your wider shoulders, and shake out your hair.

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;It&#39;s true. The stuffing you added to your bra has come unraveled, and is now sticking out of your collar. Feeling your face turn bright red, you turn away from the others and try to stuff it back in before anybody sees.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;But it&#39;s too late. Jane Morris sees it and points toward you, with a delighted laugh. &quot;Oh my!&quot; she says, beaming. &quot;$name stuffs her bra!&quot; and her sisters turn their heads to look, too.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Of course, it&#39;s true, but you don&#39;t want anyone to know that. You try to disentangle your blouse from your sweater and get everything put back in place before anybody notices.&lt;/div&gt;

Are you planning to be a cheer king for our routine? Or should we expect you to change back before then? Have the doctors given you any idea whether you&#39;ll be cured //before// you embarrass the Pep Squad out on the field, or //after//?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;&lt;if $day == 9&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;There isn&#39;t time to worry about any of your own problems during Pep Squad. $pep has everyone going through rigorous exercises -- mostly drills that she says will help build camaraderie and trust among the team. Falling backward was easy. Falling backward from a chair was harder.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;if $secret == true and $sex == &quot;male&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Every time you fall, you wonder if anybody is going to notice you&#39;re not a girl any more.

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;At the end of class, two students from the Journalism department stop by with a stack of freshly-printed school newspapers. &lt;&lt;if $path.includes(&quot;open school interview&quot;) or $path.includes(&quot;anonymous school interview&quot;)&gt;&gt;You make a note to pick one up on your way to Vocal Music. It should have your interview in it.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;You debate for a moment about picking one up on your way to Vocal Music, but there isn&#39;t time to think about it for long.

&lt;&lt;if $day == 10&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;There is little time for exercise and drill practice today. The pep squad uniforms have arrived and it&#39;s time for the all-important fitting.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Girls, girls,&quot; $pep calls over the ruckus, blowing her whistle. &quot;I know you&#39;re very excited to try on your skirts, but I have one more thing to announce before we do that. Tomorrow is the last day to transfer out of Pep Squad, so I will be evaluating each and every one of you. If you do not make the squad tomorrow, you will not be performing for the school at next Friday&#39;s football game, and you will have to be transferred out of Pep Squad. This may mean gym class for some of you, but there are other alternatives. Make sure you&#39;re practicing your drills, do your stretches, and watch that crossover step. All right, let&#39;s try on some clothes!&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You don&#39;t really want to end up in gym class again, and you cross your fingers and hope you&#39;ll pass.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;\
&lt;&lt;if $day == 11&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;$pep is putting everybody through their dance steps today in preparation for the final cut. Those that are going to make the team will stay on for next week&#39;s football game, and those who do not will have to change classes. It&#39;s exhausting, and her exacting eye is watching everyone and everything as she calls out missed beats, skipped moves, and false starts.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Turn on three! A little late, Miss Young. Don&#39;t look at me, Miss Morris, turn your head into the spin!&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;if $path.includes(&quot;SO emergency date&quot;) or $path.includes(&quot;friend emergency date&quot;)&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;The trouble is, you can&#39;t concentrate on the dance moves, because your mind keeps getting dragged back to those stolen kisses in the hallway.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;At first, it&#39;s a //nice// distraction, because the constant exercise is very difficult and it leaves the mind free to think of other things. After a few moments of idle reminiscence, you realize you&#39;re starting to get warm. Not warm from exercise, warm from ... from passion. From hormones. From your pounding heart and racing pulse that the routine alone cannot account for.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;//Oh no, not here,// you think, panting hard. //Gotta keep moving. Don&#39;t want to get kicked off the squad. That would be bad.//&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;But those kisses in the hallway //were// very nice, too...&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;//Stop,// you admonish yourself, feeling the warmth in your belly gradually turn into a rumbling, roaring fire. Your skin prickles. Your bones feel electrified. Now your head is starting to split in two—&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You have to stop the routine, gasping for breath, with one hand to your head.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;What&#39;s the matter?&quot; demands $pep. &quot;Too much for you?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Need to go to the bathroom,&quot; you gulp.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;She stares hard at you, evaluating whether you are seriously ill or injured, or whether you might be malingering with malice aforethought. &quot;You&#39;re not injured?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;No. Fine. Gotta go,&quot; you say, and without waiting for permission, you lurch in the direction of the locker rooms, feeling your limbs shivering with every step.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;//Locker room, bad idea,// you think disjointedly. //But there&#39;s bathrooms. And stalls.//&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;&lt;display &quot;SexSwitch&quot;&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;It&#39;s tough exercise today, but you must have made the grade, because $pep doesn&#39;t have anything to say to you afterward.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;//That&#39;s a relief,// you think. //I didn&#39;t want to go back to gym class.//&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;That&#39;s right,&quot; Ray gloats at the two girls. &quot;You stink. Go find some other team!&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;That&#39;s not very nice, Ray,&quot; Harold says mildly.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You go up to $eng&#39;s desk to see what scenes are available. Unfortunately, there&#39;s only one. It says: &quot;Act IV, Scene i. Rosalind, disguised as a shepherd named Ganymede, tries to teach Orlando about love by __pretending__ to be Rosalind and asking Celia to marry them.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Aw, fiddlesticks!&quot; grumbles Ray when he sees the list. &quot;It&#39;s a love scene. I //knew// nobody was going to want to do that one.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;You could be Jaques,&quot; Doris points out. &quot;He leaves on the first page.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Then I don&#39;t get no lines at all.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Celia doesn&#39;t have many lines.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Celia&#39;s a //girl,//&quot; says Ray in a withering voice.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Fine, then,&quot; you say, fed up with Ray&#39;s complaints. &quot;You can be Rosalind, the girl pretending to be a boy pretending to be a girl. Or you can be Orlando, the man who falls in love with her.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Orlando&#39;s the hero?&quot; he asks, his eyes narrowing suspiciously. &quot;All right, I&#39;ll be Orlando.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;What part do you want?&quot; Harold asks Doris politely.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;She looks at him blankly. &quot;What do you mean? Celia is the only girl left.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;And you?&quot; Harold asks, looking to you. &lt;&lt;if $openzeta == true&gt;&gt;&quot;Maybe you should play Rosalind, given ... you know, your condition.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;You&#39;d be better at playing Rosalind than me, I bet.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; But I will, if you&#39;d rather be Jaques.

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;This will be excellent,&quot; Alice says happily. &quot;I&#39;ll be the director, of course. I know this show backwards. We should all try to memorize our parts, don&#39;t you think? And I bet we could find some costumes, too.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Let&#39;s just pick a scene first,&quot; Arlene says, irritated. &quot;Before they&#39;re all gone.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You go up to $eng&#39;s desk to see what scenes are available. Unfortunately, there&#39;s only one. It says: &quot;Act IV, Scene i. Rosalind, disguised as a shepherd named Ganymede, tries to teach Orlando about love by __pretending__ to be Rosalind and asking Celia to marry them.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Nobody took this scene? It&#39;s the best scene!&quot; Alice signs her name on the page as group leader. &quot;Except maybe the scene with Jacques, //all the world&#39;s a stage,// that&#39;s a good one. Now I&#39;ve already played Celia before, and I&#39;m //dying// to play Rosalind, &lt;&lt;if $openzeta == true&gt;&gt;but maybe $currname should do that, given $poss[$sgen] condition. How&#39;s that?&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;but I&#39;ll do Celia again if someone else wants Rosalind.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; Anyone?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;There&#39;s &lt;&lt;if ($openzeta == true and $sex == &quot;male&quot;) or ($newid == true and $sex == &quot;male&quot;) or ($secret == true and $sex == &quot;female&quot;)&gt;&gt;three&lt;&lt;set _fcount to 3&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;four&lt;&lt;set _fcount to 4&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; girls here,&quot; Doris points out. &quot;And two parts for boys.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Oh, that&#39;s true,&quot; Alice says, with a look of sudden inspiration. &quot;$eng could hardly complain if I play Jaques. Or Orlando, even.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Why would you want to play a boy&#39;s part?&quot; Arlene asks acidly.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Well, one of us has to play a boy,&quot; Alice says, brushing the matter aside. &quot;As director, I nominate Doris to play Celia, &lt;&lt;if _fcount == 3&gt;&gt;$currname to play Orlando, Arlene to play Rosalind,&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;$currname to play Rosalind, Arlene to play Orlando,&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; and I&#39;ll be Jaques.

Her usual frosty look of condescension has been replaced with an uneasy smile. There is a copy of //The Aegis// under one arm.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I just wanted to say,&quot; Arlene says, &quot;that I thought — I really liked reading with you. For class yesterday.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Thanks,&quot; you say. &quot;You did very well.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Thank you,&quot; she says. Plucking up her courage, she seizes the newspaper under her arm and holds it out to you. Your interview is showing on the cover. &quot;Did you ... did this //really// happen to you?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Yes,&quot; you say, &quot;but Floyd did get some of the details wrong. Other than that, it&#39;s more or less true.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;And you just ... admitted it to everyone?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I suppose I did. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s really my //fault// that I was born with this thing, whatever it is.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;No!&quot; she says, agreeing with sudden passion. &quot;No! No, of course. It isn&#39;t //your// fault that this happened. It just //happened.// Right?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You lower your voice. &quot;Have you been having this problem too?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Arlene hesitates. &quot;I—I know someone who is.&quot; Her reluctance could not have been clearer if she had written it on her forehead. &quot;Just ... someone I know. She turns into a boy sometimes. She&#39;s never told anyone.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Except you.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Right,&quot; she says, turning pink. &quot;Except me. It&#39;s only happened a couple of times. I — she&#39;s been trying to keep it secret all summer.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I understand,&quot; you say. &lt;&lt;if $path.includes(&quot;shameful TG&quot;)&gt;&gt;&quot;I tried to hide it, too. I stayed home the first day of school.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;&quot;I tried to hide it, too. I dressed as a $girlboy[$sgen] the first day of school.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; Then I realized it wasn&#39;t going to just ... stop, you know? So we decided to tell the school, and I&#39;d just come to school as I am.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;You told the //school?//&quot; she asks, eyes going wide.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Of course. As long as I meet the dress code, they don&#39;t care. I had to change my schedule a bit, to get out of gym.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Uh huh, right. Makes sense.&quot; Arlene seems to be clinging to your words like a woman who&#39;s trying not to drown. &quot;And ... and your parents?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;They&#39;re okay with it. Mom took me to see the doctor, and we found out what it is.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;From a medical experiment on polio?&quot; she asks, and she turns her eyes to the page again, skimming madly. &quot;A vaccine. Your mother had a vaccine, and you were born like this.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Yes, that&#39;s it exactly.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;if $sex == &quot;male&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Arlene Stewart heaves a sigh of relief. &quot;Wow. So it really is just ... not anybody&#39;s fault.&quot; Her nervous face creases into a smile. &quot;Thank you. Thanks for staying to talk to me.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;So,&quot; he begins. &quot;Was that ... was that //you// in the newspaper yesterday?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You nod. &quot;That was me.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;And it&#39;s all true?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;It&#39;s true enough,&quot; you say. &quot;Floyd make up some of it.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Hmm, yeah,&quot; Harold says, his brows folding in unaccustomed thought. &quot;So that actually happened to you?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Yes. Last Wednesday. Why?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Harold leans in and lowers his voice. &quot;It happened to me too, last month. It was during the baseball season. I woke up one day and I was a girl.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;What did you do?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Nothing. I played baseball,&quot; Harold says. &quot;I didn&#39;t tell anyone. And two days later I changed back, and it hasn&#39;t happened since. Until I saw your article in the paper, I thought I was the only person it ever happened to.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;There&#39;s more,&quot; you say. &quot;Apparently it&#39;s going around.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;He nods. &quot;Yes, I read your interview. Gosh, do you know how //glad// I am to know I&#39;m not the only one?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I can imagine!&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;So they just ... they //let// you come to school however you want?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&lt;&lt;if $sex == $startsex&gt;&gt;&quot;Sure. As long as I meet the dress code.&quot;&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;&quot;Well, yes,&quot; you say, gesturing to your outfit. &quot;As long as I meet the dress code.&quot;&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I bet if I tried that, I&#39;d get kicked off the baseball team,&quot; he says glumly.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Maybe,&quot; you say. &quot;I had to change my gym class. But you know, women play baseball, too. There&#39;s that All-Women&#39;s Baseball League, right? I&#39;m sure you could play if you wanted to.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Yeah, maybe. I&#39;d sure feel pretty peculiar going out on the field in a skirt.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div claass=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&lt;&lt;if $startsex == &quot;female&quot;&gt;&gt;&quot;You&#39;ll get used to it,&quot; you say. &quot;But I&#39;m with you — I&#39;d rather wear trousers out there.&quot;&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;&quot;I&#39;m with you,&quot; you say with a grin. &quot;Skirts are all right, but trousers are much better for sports.&quot;&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Harold looks cheered up with your camaraderie. &quot;Hey, do you think we could get together some time and talk more about this?&quot; he asks. &quot;I&#39;ve been wanting to talk to someone about this for //ages.//&quot;&lt;/div&gt;

He&#39;s nearly made Eagle Scout as well, and you and he have been competing for years to see who can get the most badges.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;A little while later, Dale Norton hops out of the back of his old man&#39;s beat-up farm truck and slouches over to greet you, slapping dust from his uniform. At least now you can understand why he always shows up looking so dirty.&lt;/div&gt;

Lorraine sits down beside you to wait, sanding at her nails with an emery board.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Sylvia Todd arrives a little while later, trudging up the street with her face all red. She&#39;s always looked a little out of breath to you, which she puts down to asthma, but which her mother insists is baby fat, and not enough exercise.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;\
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;At last, the time for the scout meeting draws near, and you stand up, dust yourself off, straighten your uniform, and enter the house.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;&lt;if $page == 1&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You knock on the door and wait for $scout to answer. The noisy clatter of a vacuum cleaner is rattling around inside the house, so you knock harder. After a little while, the noise dies away, and $nom[$sgen] answers and peers out at you. &quot;$name? You&#39;re a little early, but come on in.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I know you&#39;re still setting up,&quot; you say apologetically, &quot;but I wanted to make sure to talk to you about ... the condition I told you about last night. On the phone.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;$nomcap[$sgen] looks at you blankly for a moment, then reacts. &quot;Oh, right, yes,&quot; $scout says, glancing around as if searching for Communist spies lurking in the front garden. &quot;Yes, I remember. You know ... why don&#39;t you come in for a moment?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You step inside into the front hallway, and $scout closes the door behind you. &quot;To be honest, you&#39;re not the only one of my scouts who has had this problem recently,&quot; $nom[$sgen] admits in a low voice. &quot;I don&#39;t want to name any names or anything, but we had an incident earlier this summer. We tried to keep it quiet, because we didn&#39;t want the poor ... the poor scout to be embarrassed or anything, at least any worse than — well, anyway,&quot; $scout says with an uncomfortable laugh. &quot;We&#39;re not total strangers to this condition.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;So do you know what it is?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I&#39;m afraid not,&quot; $scout says sadly. &quot;The scout&#39;s mother was going to talk to a specialist, but I never heard anything.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;So what am I going to do?&quot; you ask. &quot;I can&#39;t exactly stay in &lt;&lt;if $startsex == &quot;male&quot;&gt;&gt;Boy&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;Girl&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; Scouts if I&#39;m a $girlboy[$gen], can I?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;No, the rules are pretty firm about that,&quot; $scout says. &quot;But I&#39;ve talked with &lt;&lt;if $startsex == &quot;male&quot;&gt;&gt;$fscout, who runs a Girl Scout troop, and she&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;$mscout, who runs a Boy Scout troop, and he&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; said there wouldn&#39;t be any problem taking on a new scout starting next week. You know, if your condition persists.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;But how would I earn my &lt;&lt;if $startsex == &quot;male&quot;&gt;&gt;Eagle Scout badges?&quot;&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;Curved Bar badges?&quot;&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; you ask.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;We&#39;re working something out between us,&quot; $scout says. &quot;Some of the badges are similar, and you might not have to start completely from scratch. You&#39;ll be familiar with a lot of the things they do over there. And you&#39;re very bright, and maybe this won&#39;t last very long, and you&#39;ll be back over here before you know it.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;That doesn&#39;t sound all that promising, but you thank $scout for trying.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;&lt;if $page == 2&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;The meeting is taken up by the last-minute organizing details of &lt;&lt;if $startsex == &quot;male&quot;&gt;&gt;the fishing and camping trip&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;the cabin retreat&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; coming up the following weekend.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;If you haven&#39;t had your permission slips signed, be sure to bring them next week,&quot; $scout tells the group. &lt;&lt;if $startsex == &quot;male&quot;&gt;&gt;&quot;We&#39;re going to load up the packs on Friday night, and get an early start on Saturday, around seven o&#39;clock. We&#39;ll arrive by ten and distribute the packs, one for each boy. We&#39;ll draw straws for who has to carry the Army tent, and we&#39;ll trade off carrying it: twice on the way in, and twice on the way out. It&#39;ll be a two-hour hike, so get plenty of rest.&quot;&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;&quot;We&#39;re going to load up the car on Friday night, and get an early start on Saturday, around seven o&#39;clock. We&#39;ll arrive by ten and unload everything into the cabin. There will be a list of chores at the cabin, and you&#39;ll all need to sign up for three of them: one meal, one chore inside, and one chore outside.&quot;&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Will there be badges we can earn?&quot; asks one scout.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Of course,&quot; $scout smiles. &quot;There&#39;s going to be lots to do, and I&#39;ll be checking people off for any badges you happen to earn while you&#39;re there. Now, I&#39;m going to need two volunteers &lt;&lt;if $startsex == &quot;male&quot;&gt;&gt;to be trail safety monitors. You&#39;ll carry the first-aid kits and the trail maps and you&#39;ll be in charge of making sure every scout makes it to the camping site. Anyone?&quot;&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;to be house monitors. You&#39;ll be in charge of making sure the chores get done, making sure every girl has a place to sleep, and keeping an eye on the wood stoves so it doesn&#39;t get cold. Anyone?&quot;&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;&lt;if $page == 3&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You raise your hand to volunteer. One good thing about scouting is that leadership positions have never intimidated you.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;if $path.includes(&quot;tell scouts&quot;)&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;But $scout doesn&#39;t seem to be impressed, possibly because $nom[$sgen]&#39;s still thinking about your condition. &quot;Yes, excellent,&quot; $nom[$sgen] says, sounding slightly less than enthusiastic. &quot;Very good. We can talk about it more this week. Is there anyone else?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;It looks like your mysterious condition is threatening to derail your scouting career.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Later, after the meeting, $scout takes you aside. &quot;I&#39;m glad to see you&#39;re volunteering,&quot; $nom[$sgen] says, &quot;because I always like to see my scouts stepping forward and taking charge. But maybe this isn&#39;t the right week, all things considered. I&#39;ll tell &lt;&lt;if $startsex == &quot;male&quot;&gt;&gt;$fscout&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;$mscout&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; about your willingness to chip in, and maybe that&#39;ll be enough to put in a good word for you over there. I understand next weekend they&#39;re &lt;&lt;if $startsex == &quot;male&quot;&gt;&gt;doing a cabin retreat.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;going fishing.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; You&#39;ll like it, I&#39;m sure.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Yes, your scouting career is definitely taking a left turn.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Yes! Excellent,&quot; $scout says, pointing at you. &quot;Thank you, $name. That&#39;s what I like to see. Who wants to be my second monitor? Anyone?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You feel a little guilty. Everybody&#39;s going to be relying on you next weekend, and you&#39;re not sure whether you&#39;re going to be capable of handling the job. You hope nobody finds out.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;\
&lt;&lt;if $page == 4&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Leadership positions have never intimidated you. Scouting has been very good at giving you chances to lead. On the other hand, maybe this isn&#39;t one of them. Someone else should get the chance this time, especially since you don&#39;t know what the future of your condition will be.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;if $path.includes(&quot;tell scouts&quot;)&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Anyone? Anyone?&quot; $scout asks, surveying the crowd of $girlsboys[$sgen]. You get the feeling that $nom[$sgen]&#39;s deliberately avoiding your gaze.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;//Yes, it&#39;s probably for best that I sit this one out,// you think. //Just in case.//&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Later, after the meeting, $scout takes you aside. &quot;I think it&#39;s probably for the best that you didn&#39;t volunteer,&quot; $nom[$sgen] says, &quot;all things considered. Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;m still going to put in a good word for you with &lt;&lt;if $startsex == &quot;male&quot;&gt;&gt;$fscout&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;$mscout&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; and see if we can&#39;t get you situated over there. I understand next weekend they&#39;re &lt;&lt;if $startsex == &quot;male&quot;&gt;&gt;doing a cabin retreat.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;going fishing.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; You&#39;ll like it, I&#39;m sure.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;//Looks like $scout agrees with me,// you realize glumly. //They don&#39;t need me here at all.//&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Anyone? Anyone?&quot; $scout asks, surveying the crowd of $girlsboys[$sgen]. $nomcap[$sgen] keeps glancing your way encouragingly, but you sit on your hands and wait for someone else to step up.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;//It&#39;s probably for best that I sit this one out,// you think. //Just in case.//&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Still, you feel a little guilty. This is the kind of thing you&#39;d normally be first in line for. Just when everybody needs a leader, here&#39;s you with this strange condition, unable to participate.&lt;/div&gt;

There&#39;s always a distinct whiff of antiseptic about him, and possibly of gin. You&#39;re not sure how old he is, but Mom always says he was the doctor who helped her deliver you (and $sibnick), so he must be in his fifties.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; He smiles when he sees you and asks how you&#39;ve been.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;When you&#39;ve stammered out an answer, he asks you to be seated on his exam table, and then he conducts a brief exam: eyes, ears, mouth, and throat. Dixie assists him by taking your pulse, your temperature and your blood pressure, and making notes on a clipboard when he mutters things like &quot;pupils equal and reactive to light&quot; and &quot;negative maxillary lymph nodes.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;

Is that correct?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Uh, yes,&quot; you say. &quot;It happened &lt;&lt;if $path.includes(&quot;SO all the way&quot;) or $path.includes(&quot;friend all the way&quot;)&gt;&gt;on Friday night.&quot;&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;after I went to bed on Friday night.&quot;&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;After your date on Friday?&quot; he asks.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Yes. How did you know—&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;He looks at you pointedly over his spectacles. &quot;After your date, then?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Yes.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;And during your date, I assume you engaged in some ... romantic activity?&quot; he asks. &quot;Kissing, petting, things of that nature?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;There doesn&#39;t seem to be any point denying it, so you nod.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;And before your condition presented on Wednesday, may I assume you were engaged in similar activity?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Well, yes, but we didn&#39;t—&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I&#39;m not your mother,&quot; Dr Bennett says, &quot;or your pastor. I&#39;m your doctor, and I&#39;m trying to get to the bottom of this. I won&#39;t tell her anything that isn&#39;t medically relevant. Privacy is our watchword.&quot; He adjusts his glasses, waiting expectantly. &quot;Well?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Yes. We kissed, a little.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;He nods somberly. &quot;That&#39;s good news. Yes, I said good news. That means we can definitely be sure that your condition is not completely unknown.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;You know what I have?&quot; you ask, with some relief. &quot;What is it?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;if $path.includes(&quot;call doctor&quot;)&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I came out to the house and examined you on Wednesday,&quot; he says. &quot;I assume nothing has changed since then?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;No, sir,&quot; you say.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;There doesn&#39;t seem to be a need to do another exam, then,&quot; he says. &quot;Now, is there anything you can remember about what you were doing on Tuesday? Anything that you think might have set this off?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You think of the afternoon sitting on the bed and making out with $so. &quot;No, not really.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;He gives you a sharp look over the rims of his spectacles. &quot;Spending time with &lt;&lt;if $startsex == &quot;male&quot;&gt;&gt;a girlfriend,&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;a boyfriend,&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; perhaps? Kissing, petting, things of that nature?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Then yes,&quot; you say. &quot;But we didn&#39;t—&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I&#39;m not your mother,&quot; Dr Bennett says, &quot;or your pastor. I&#39;m your doctor, and I&#39;m trying to get to the bottom of this. I won&#39;t tell her anything that isn&#39;t medically relevant. Privacy is our watchword. Still, it&#39;s good news.&quot; On seeing your stunned expression, he says, &quot;Yes, I said good news. That means we can definitely be sure that your condition is not completely unknown.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;You know what I have?&quot; you ask, with some relief. &quot;What is it?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;He makes you undress halfway, and performs a brief and professional inspection of the key areas of your body. With a grunt, he rises to his feet, gesturing for you to cover yourself up again.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I&#39;ll be dipped,&quot; he says, rising to his feet with a grunt. &quot;Damnedest thing I&#39;ve ever seen. I&#39;ve //heard// about this somewhere, though. Give me a minute.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;He leaves the exam room, leaving you sitting on the table. After a length telephone conversation in the other room, Dr Bennett returns. &quot;Let me ask you a question. Did you happen to be spending any time on Tuesday with, let&#39;s say, &lt;&lt;if $startsex == &quot;male&quot;&gt;&gt;a girlfriend&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;a boyfriend&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; or someone like that?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Yes,&quot; you say. &quot;We kissed a little, but—&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I&#39;m not your mother,&quot; Dr Bennett says, &quot;or your pastor. I&#39;m your doctor, and I&#39;m trying to get to the bottom of this.

&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;\
--[[wait for the diagnosis|1948 Doctor Chat][$page to 1]]
&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;\
&lt;&lt;if $page == 1&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Let&#39;s get your mother in here,&quot; Dr Bennett says, and calls for the nurse to bring her in. When Mom is settled in a chair, Dr Bennett clears his throat. &quot;I have a preliminary diagnosis for $name&#39;s current condition, and there&#39;s good news,&quot; he says. &quot;At least we know what the condition //is.// It&#39;s called Diphormic Zeta Chromosome Syndrome. It&#39;s been seen in a couple of cases before, and we think we have established a vector of transmission.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Oh, thank heavens,&quot; Mom says. &quot;Where did $nom[$sgen] get this from?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;$nomcap[$sgen] got it from you, actually,&quot; the doctor tells her.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Me? That&#39;s absurd. I&#39;ve never — you&#39;ve been my doctor for //years,// I&#39;ve never had anything happen to me like this.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I&#39;m afraid it&#39;s &lt;&lt;if $path.includes(&quot;call doctor&quot;)&gt;&gt;true,&quot; Dr Bennett says. &quot;When $name called me on the phone and told me $poss[$sgen] symptoms, it put me in mind of a study I had read about. &lt;&lt;if $path.includes(&quot;polio newspaper&quot;)&gt;&gt;Then $nom[$sgen] reminded me about some strange side effects that have been resulted from the Kind vaccine trials. I pulled your file, Leah, and //you// were a participant in that vaccine trial when you were seventeen.&quot;&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;I couldn&#39;t remember where I&#39;d seen it, but then I found an article in the newspaper that brought it all back to me. There have been some strange side effects as a result of the Kind vaccine trials. I pulled your file, Leah, just to check, and it turns out //you// were in that trial when you were seventeen.&quot;&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;very likely,&quot; Dr Bennett says. &quot;I&#39;ll have to pull your file to check, Leah,&quot; he says to your mother, &quot;but this may be a side effect from the Kind vaccine trials. If I recall, //you// participated in that study when you were seventeen.&quot;&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Yes,&quot; she says, flustered. Maybe Mom finds it as strange as you do when people call her //Leah.// &quot;I remember that. They lined us up and gave us an injection, and then they followed up with us for a year afterward. I didn&#39;t get polio myself, but some of the other kids in my class did.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Yes, the vaccine was a failure in that respect,&quot; Dr Bennett agrees. &quot;But there was something else that happened. Either it created — or awakened, we don&#39;t know — a new kind of chromosome production in the subject&#39;s gametes. Sperm and egg cells,&quot; he adds, for clarity. &quot;Normally, men and women have either an XY or an XX pair. The Kind vaccine stimulated a new kind of chromosome, which we call the Z chromosome. It has dimorphic properties, allowing it to take a form similar to an X or a Y chromosome. It can hide for years. So when you participated in that vaccine study, Leah, it affected only your egg cells, and it allowed the Z chromosome to pass along to your children.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Mom&#39;s hand leaps to her throat. &quot;Children? Then $sib has it, too?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;It seems that this is the case,&quot; Dr Bennett says, nodding gravely. &quot;She may yet be too young for the Z chromosome to become activated, which is why her first transformation has not yet occurred. Dr Kind, who is still at the University of Washington, thinks it takes a surge of hormonal activity to first &#39;awaken&#39; the Z chromosome, after which it becomes much more active. Every time the patient experiences a surge of hormones, the Z chromosome responds by changing shape. This causes the patient&#39;s body to rapidly transform from male to female, and vice-versa.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;set $page to -1&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;display &quot;1948 Doctor Chat&quot;&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;\
&lt;&lt;if $page == 2&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Not yet,&quot; Dr Bennett admits. &quot;It&#39;s still very new. The vaccine trials went on from 1931 to 1938. After that, the trials were canceled when it was determined there was no protective effect against polio. And, of course, it&#39;s only just now that we&#39;re starting to see patients who are old enough and mature enough for the Z chromosome to manifest itself.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I hope somebody is working on it,&quot; Mom says.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I&#39;m sure there is someone out there. I&#39;m afraid there&#39;s still so much about the Z chromosome that we just don&#39;t know. It could be years.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;set $page to -1&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;display &quot;1948 Doctor Chat&quot;&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;\
&lt;&lt;if $page == 3&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;No, there a number of patients in the Puget Sound area who have Dimorphic Zeta Chromosome Syndrome,&quot; the doctor assures you. &quot;Most of the patients are in the Seattle area, with a few in the outlying areas, because the vaccine trials were done here through the University of Washington. And since people generally stay fairly close to where they were brought up, that&#39;s why you find many of those patients in this general region.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Like who?&quot; you want to know. &quot;Do any of them go to my school?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I couldn&#39;t tell you that,&quot; he answers. &quot;Remember our watchword is privacy.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Oh, I //see.// So that&#39;s why nobody has heard of it yet,&quot; Mom says in  dawning realization. &quot;You can&#39;t tell anyone.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;That&#39;s right. We can try to publish our findings, of course, but the national medical journals are still skeptical it&#39;s a real syndrome at all. They probably assume we&#39;ve all made clerical mistakes or something. I suppose in a few more months or years we&#39;ll start seeing more and more patients, and then they&#39;ll have to pay attention. The vaccine trial went on for seven years.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;And then what happens?&quot; Mom asks. &quot;Is $name going to pass it on to $poss[$sgen] children, too? Am I supposed to expect grandchildren who just ... keep changing whenever they want?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;We don&#39;t know. This may not be an inheritable trait. Given the long delay before the Z chromosome becomes active, it could be fifteen or twenty years before we&#39;ll see a second wave of Dimorphic Zetas crop up.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;&lt;if $page == 4&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Not as far as I know, no,&quot; Dr Bennett says. &quot;This doesn&#39;t seem to be some kind of traditional disease process, like a bacterium or a virus. That means it&#39;s not like the common cold, which you have for a week and then you&#39;re over it. It also means — we //think// — that it can&#39;t be caught. At least not in any way we&#39;re familiar with.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;So we&#39;re safe?&quot; Mom asks.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;The odds of that are good, yes.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;So I don&#39;t have to worry about $name and $sib going to school,&quot; she goes on, exploring the limits of the horrors she must face. &quot;We won&#39;t have their friends coming down with this, too. We won&#39;t have to pull $acc[$sgen] out of school.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;No. No, I wouldn&#39;t recommend that. If you find that $name&#39;s school — it&#39;s Renton Comprehensive, yes? — if they give you any trouble, give them my number. There doesn&#39;t seem to be any physical danger posed by this condition. Not to students whose parents weren&#39;t in the trial, anyway.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;set $page to -1&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;display &quot;1948 Doctor Chat&quot;&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;\
&lt;&lt;if $page == 5&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Yes, absolutely,&quot; Dr Bennett says, and reaches for his notepad. &quot;And feel free to have the school call my nurse if they have any questions. You //are// telling the school, yes?&quot; he asks, looking up from his writing.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&lt;&lt;if $path.includes(&quot;known zeta&quot;)&gt;&gt;&quot;Yes, we already told them,&quot;&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;&quot;We haven&#39;t said anything,&quot;&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; Mom says.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;As I said, I don&#39;t mind communicating with the school staff — in a general way, mind you, not about any patient in particular — and reassuring them that everything seems very safe. Awkward, perhaps, and a little bit peculiar for one&#39;s social life, but otherwise there isn&#39;t any danger.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Mom takes the note and tucks it away into her purse.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;set $page to -1&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;display &quot;1948 Doctor Chat&quot;&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;\
&lt;&lt;if $page == 7&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;So far, we find that Dimorphic Zetas start off fairly androgynous,&quot; Dr Bennett explains. &quot;That means neither particularly male, nor particularly female. When the Z chromosome first awakens, it starts to exert a strong influence on your hormonal development. This can cause your male side to become bigger, taller, stronger, and more masculine, and your female side to become smaller, weaker, and more feminine. We&#39;re not entirely certain what causes this, but it may be psychosomatic in some fashion. That means it could be controlled by the subconscious mind. You turn into the kind of man, or woman, that you think that you //ought// to. And, of course, we have found that the longer you remain in one form or another, the more pronounced it will become over time.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Is there any way to make it stop?&quot; you ask.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I&#39;m afraid not,&quot; he answers. &quot;You&#39;re at a time of your life when your body is producing a lot of hormones, and it&#39;s bound to cause your Z chromosome to trigger — on its own, even.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;So if I stay a $girlboy[$sgen], it won&#39;t be as bad,&quot; you conclude.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I think you may be correct. But this effect will soon settle down. The Z chromosome only strongly affects your form for about the first thirty days. After that, your male and female sides will likely stop changing so much.&quot; He coughs lightly. &quot;At least, that&#39;s what the literature says.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;

Your face seems the same as it ever was, and certainly clearer than yesterday — no little wispy hairs on your upper lip, for starters. Your hands are small and delicate again. Your feet seem like they&#39;ll fit in your shoes.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;It&#39;s so hard to tell. Maybe it&#39;s just your imagination playing tricks on you. //Did I really just change back exactly as I was?// you ask yourself, peering at your reflection. //Or am I seeing things?//&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&lt;&lt;if $ht lt 172&gt;&gt;You&#39;ve definitely shrunk a little.

Even when you reached to open your closet door, your wrist barked painfully into the knob, like it was suddenly too high.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;You&#39;re pretty sure you&#39;ve shrunk a tiny bit, but maybe not quite enough to measure. The room just seems wrong, like it&#39;s a bit too large now.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;if $cupsize lt 2&gt;&gt;Maybe your breasts have grown a little bit, too. You heft them experimentally. They never really did develop the way other girls&#39; boobs did. Maybe now they have, just a tiny bit?&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;You can clearly tell you&#39;ve got a little more bounce going on up top. Your boobs never expanded beyond your basic AA-cup bra before, but now as you heft them experimentally in your hands, they do seem like they have more weight to them. An A cup, maybe?&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Your face seems the same as it ever was — maybe a few more tiny whiskers on your upper lip, but that&#39;s about it. Your hands are a bit bigger and stronger, and your feet seem a bit more substantial.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;It&#39;s so hard to tell. Maybe it&#39;s just your imagination playing tricks on you.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&lt;&lt;if $ht gt 170&gt;&gt;You&#39;ve grown during the night. Your arms //definitely// longer, because you can compare them to the sleeves of the pajama top you were wearing on Tuesday night. Did it always fit this way? And when you reached for the knob on your closet door, your knuckles barked painfully into the knob, like somebody had moved it slightly lower.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;It certainly //feels// like you&#39;ve grown a tiny bit taller. You&#39;re almost positive that your shoulders are wider. It must be.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;if $strength gt 50&gt;&gt;And you seem to have more muscles than you had before.

It&#39;s wickedly sharp, much sharper than the one you use on your legs, but you suppose that&#39;s only natural. Men don&#39;t have as much to shave, so the blade stays sharp longer.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You try to keep the skin of your face stretched taut as the razor goes by, because it seems to work better that way. As a result, you find yourself making faces in the mirror, opening your mouth, craning your neck, and you are reminded of the times you&#39;ve seen your father do this.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You don&#39;t have many whiskers, and the ones you do have are tiny, but there&#39;s something very satisfying about stroking that sharp razor over your skin. It&#39;s much faster than doing your legs, too.&lt;/div&gt;

It&#39;s strangely satisfying to see the hair disappear, stroke by stroke, as you move along your right leg, up from the shin, past the knee, up to the top of your thigh. In spite of yourself, you go into a zen-like trance, focusing on just one stroke at a time.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;And then, as you&#39;re halfway through your left leg, she pops right into the bathroom. While you&#39;re //naked.// She never used to do that.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Mom!&quot; you protest, dunking your legs under the water to hide your handiwork. Showing off shaved legs to your //mother// is mortifying.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;She puts some tins and tubs on the bathroom counter. &quot;This is for your underarms,&quot; she says, holding up a small tin. &quot;Madame Jones&#39; Body Sweet Deodorant. It&#39;ll make you smell nice. Don&#39;t forget to shave there, too. And this is Palmolive soap, it&#39;s good for your skin. And this is Pond&#39;s Cold Cream, it&#39;s for taking off your makeup. You don&#39;t want to get makeup all over your pillowcases; I just washed them. And do the cold cream over the sink, not in the tub.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;

It feels strange wearing the towel only around your waist, but there doesn&#39;t seem to be any point to wearing it up high. The towel swaddled on your head to dry your hair doesn&#39;t seem to be doing very much either.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;Even when you&#39;re able to get out of the tub, your mother pops into the bathroom to dress you in a towel.

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Mom and $sib come in the kitchen door just as you&#39;re setting the bread out to cool. &quot;Thanks, sweetie,&quot; Mom says. &quot;$sibnick and I were able to muscle the trash can down to the street, so that&#39;s taken care of.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;

You try to measure yourself up to the mirror, looking for some difference you can spot.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; Your muscles have seeped away overnight, too, because you can see your biceps are just slightly more slender than they were before. And your hair has sprouted outward, giving you something like a full, shaggy bob. It must be &lt;&lt;if $unit == &quot;metric&quot;&gt;&gt;ten centimeters long, maybe more.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;four inches long, maybe more.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;\
&lt;&lt;if $startsex == &quot;male&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You&#39;ve lost some height, too. &lt;&lt;if $ht gte 171&gt;&gt;A tiny bit.

Your bottom feels huge, as if it suddenly inflated like Mom&#39;s rising bread dough.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You&#39;ve gained some heigt, too. &lt;&lt;if $ht lte 173&gt;&gt;A tiny bit. Hard to tell, maybe, but you know it happened because your dress feels somewhat tighter across the shoulders and shorter at the knees.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;Maybe a lot. You can&#39;t really tell, standing alone in the dark, but you must have grown &lt;&lt;if $unit == &quot;metric&quot;&gt;&gt;a few centimeters,&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;an inch,&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; at least.

Your arms feel bigger and thicker.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;too. Your arms are definitely heavier, and quite a bit stronger.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;And that&#39;s not all, either. Your boyish hips are back, making your dress hang awkward and flat on your frame.

A high school diploma was often considered a terminal degree — that is, a complete education without any need to pursue further knowledge in college or at a university. Many high schools were labeled &quot;comprehensive,&quot; meaning they were suitable for most Americans to become self-sufficient and to find gainful employment. Only about 30% of students graduated with a high school diploma, but there were many good jobs available in agriculture, road work, construction and repair that did not require one, and high school was tailored to these needs.]&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;aside&quot;&gt;[Most high schools taught a range of vocational skills, trade skills, and home-life skills, in addition to a regimen of basic academics. Programs in Industrial Arts, such as auto shop and wood shop, were given heavy funding in order to produce mechanics and builders. Home Economics courses were taught, to give housewives practical skills in cooking, appliance repair and home budgeting. Practical business mathematics were elevated over denser texts on trigonometry and calculus. Literacy and public speaking were emphasized over literary critique. It was thought that anything more rigorous could be learned at college, for those few who required it.]&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;The crowd of students in front of the school, just down the steps from the office, seems slightly thicker than normal. On a Friday it wouldn&#39;t be usual to see so many eager faces lining the wide, shallow steps. Most kids want to beat feet and get home as quick as they can. But not today.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;$bully is waiting there for you, halfway down the steps. Halfway to the sidewalk which leads to the safety of home.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;There you are,&quot; $bully says, when $nom[$bgen] sees you. &quot;I thought you might chicken out. I&#39;ll give you that, &lt;&lt;if $newid == true&gt;&gt;$currname, or $name, or whoever you are,&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;$name,&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;if $bgen == 3&gt;&gt;you got stones on you.&quot;&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;you&#39;re not a fraidy cat.&quot;&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; $nomcap[$bgen] levers $reflana[$bgen] away from the railing where $nom[$bgen] had been leaning.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&lt;&lt;if $path.includes(&quot;agree to fight bully&quot;)&gt;&gt;&quot;What&#39;s your buzzin&#39;, cousin?&quot; you ask, annoyed. &quot;What&#39;d you want to see me for?&quot;&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;&quot;I don&#39;t know why you&#39;ve got a beef with me,&quot; you say. &quot;I haven&#39;t done anything to you.&quot;&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;if $path.includes(&quot;dickgirl schedule&quot;) or $path.includes(&quot;pussyboy schedule&quot;)&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Then let me tell you,&quot; $bully says. &quot;Ever since you showed up at school this year, this whole Zeta thing has been going around. &lt;&lt;if $bgen == 3&gt;&gt;You think we like watching you skip from class to class, pretending like you&#39;re date bait?&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;Do you really think we gals really enjoy watching you pretend to be a hunk of heartbreak?&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;if $path.includes(&quot;open school interview&quot;)&gt;&gt;And then you go and do that //interview,// bragging all about how it just //happened// to you one day, and aren&#39;t you special?&quot;&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;And then that article in the paper comes out, talking about how this is all just //happening// all of a sudden, and aren&#39;t these kids special?&quot;&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;if $bgen == 3&gt;&gt;$bully spits over the railing with disgust.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;$bully makes a vomitous noise, opening her mouth and rolling her eyes.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; &quot;It makes me sick.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&lt;&lt;if $path.includes(&quot;agree to fight bully&quot;)&gt;&gt;&quot;If you&#39;ve got a bug up your butt about it, that&#39;s your problem,&quot; you tell $acc[$bgen].&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;&quot;I didn&#39;t make any of that happen,&quot; you say to $acc[$bgen]. &quot;It&#39;s not //my// fault. Why take it out on me?&quot;&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;if $path.includes(&quot;admit dating&quot;)&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Oh, and your &lt;&lt;if $startsex == &quot;male&quot;&gt;&gt;//girlfriend//&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;//boyfriend//&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; over here,&quot; $bully goes on, ignoring you and turning to $so. $nomcap[$sogen] is standing hesitantly on the edge of the crowd, and tries to disappear into the throng behind $acc[$sogen], but it&#39;s too late. &quot;$nomcap[$sogen] thinks it&#39;s just //peachy.// Isn&#39;t that nice. Isn&#39;t that just the bees&#39; knees.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;elseif $path.includes(&quot;hide dating&quot;)&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Oh, and telling everybody how //available// you are,&quot; $bully goes on, sneering. &quot;And all this time I heard you were going out with //this// one.&quot; $nomcap[$bgen] points to $so, who is standing hesitantly on the edge of the crowd. $nomcap[$sogen] tries to disappear into the throng behind $acc[$sogen], but it&#39;s too late. &quot;Yes, your &lt;&lt;if $startsex == &quot;male&quot;&gt;&gt;boyfriend is a girl.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;girlfriend is a boy.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; Isn&#39;t that just the bees&#39; knees.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;\
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;You leave $acc[$sogen] out of this,&quot; you warn $acc[$bgen].&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;$bully seems to recognize that $nom[$bgen]&#39;s scored a hit. &quot;You want to talk about someone else? How about the way you and $fr are always sitting together at lunch. I bet //$nom[$fgen]// really likes how you get turned into a $girlboy[$soppgen]. Was that you I saw &lt;&lt;if $path.includes(&quot;BFF makeout&quot;)&gt;&gt;kissing behind the backstop?&lt;&lt;elseif $path.includes(&quot;friend date&quot;)&gt;&gt;having a nice date down at the fish and chip place?&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;hiding together behind the gym?&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; What else were you doing? I bet it was lots of fun.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You look around and see $fr&#39;s pale, shocked face.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Then a voice rings out from the crowd. &quot;What&#39;s the problem, $bully?&quot; asks Doris Thacker, from English. &quot;Are you jealous, because you can&#39;t get any action yourself?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&lt;&lt;if $bgen == 4&gt;&gt;&quot;More than you, four-eyes,&quot; $bully says dismissively.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;&quot;You&#39;re one to talk, four-eyes,&quot; $bully laughs at her.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; When Doris clams up again, a hurt look on her face, $bully turns to you. &quot;Is she the only friend you brought to defend you? Because she&#39;s not much, is she?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;if _crowd.length gt 1&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;set _friends to 1&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;if _crowd[1] == &quot;Harold&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;No,&quot; says a male voice. You turn to see Harold, stepping out from the wall of students and &lt;&lt;if $bgen == 3&gt;&gt;cracking his knuckles. His biceps flex impressively. &quot;Is that the only //face// you brought? Because you&#39;re going to need another one.&quot;&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;crossing his arms. His big biceps flex impressively. &quot;Is that the only //mouth// you brought? Because, oh, &#39;four eyes.&#39; How clever.&quot;&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt; It&#39;s been easy to forget how athletic Harold is, but he looks even bigger now. &lt;&lt;if $bgen == 3&gt;&gt;$bully sizes him up in alarm.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;$bully takes a step back in alarm.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; &quot;Why are you defending this freak?&quot; $nom[$bgen] demands.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Because I&#39;ve got Zeta, too,&quot; Harold says. &quot;If you&#39;re looking for some Zeta kid to pick on, why don&#39;t you start right here?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;elseif _crowd[1] == &quot;Arlene&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;No,&quot; says a female voice. You turn to see Arlene, stepping out from the wall of students, hands on her hips. &quot;No, she&#39;s not, you &lt;&lt;if $bgen == 3&gt;&gt;impotent little goon.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;cross-eyed little dishrag.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; There&#39;s //me.// That&#39;s more than enough for a &lt;&lt;if $bgen == 3&gt;&gt;gully-washed ragamuffin sad sack&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;bow-legged sidecar floozy&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; like you.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;It&#39;s hard to forget how sharp-tongued Arlene could be when she was in the mood, but she&#39;s still just getting warmed up. $bully actually takes a step back. &quot;Why are you defending this freak?&quot; $nom[$bgen] demands.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I just so happen to be a Zeta myself,&quot; Arlene says hotly. &quot;And I //still// make a better &lt;&lt;if $bgen == 3&gt;&gt;man&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;woman&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; than you do, or ever will. If you&#39;re looking for poor Zeta to pick on, you&#39;re going to have me to deal with, too.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;elseif _crowd[1] == &quot;Phyllis&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Why don&#39;t you shut your mouth before all the flies escape?&quot; asks Phyllis Watson, emerging from the crowd. &quot;$name is on my squad, and I&#39;m not going to let you push anybody on my team around. You got that?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;$bully may be &lt;&lt;if $bgen == 3&gt;&gt;a boy, and rather muscular in build,&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;tall for a girl,&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; but Phyllis is slightly taller and very athletic from her years on the Pep Squad. She&#39;s also a senior, and very pretty, and both of those carry with them a certain air of intimidation.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;elseif _crowd[1] == &quot;Alvin&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Did I hear you call $shop&#39;s daughter &#39;four eyes?&#39;&quot; asks a male voice, and Alvin Price looms out of the crowd. &quot;I&#39;m sure her old man would love to mount your &lt;&lt;if $bgen == 3&gt;&gt;nuts&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;head&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; on his wall. And lay off $name, too, unless you want a nice knuckle sandwich. That&#39;s my bass drummer you&#39;re giving static to.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Alvin is a senior and frighteningly tall, which is why he&#39;s a perfect bandleader — everyone can see him. $bully doesn&#39;t stand a chance of intimidating him.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;\
&lt;&lt;if _crowd.length gt 2&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;set _friends to 2&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;if _crowd[2] == &quot;Phyllis&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Yeah,&quot; says Phyllis Watson, captain of the Pep Squad. &quot;Why don&#39;t you shut your mouth before all the flies escape? I&#39;m not letting you push around any of the $girlsboys[$gen] on my squad.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;elseif _crowd[2] == &quot;Alvin&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;If $shop hears you say that,&quot; says Alvin Price, captain of the Marching Band, &quot;he&#39;s gonna have your &lt;&lt;if $bgen == 3&gt;&gt;nuts&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;head&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; on his wall. And while you&#39;re at it, leave my bass drummer alone, will you?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;elseif _crowd[2] == &quot;Gerald&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Yeah!&quot; says Gerald Myers. &quot;$name&#39;s nice, $nom[$gen]&#39;s never done anything to you. Dry up and blow away, will ya?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;elseif _crowd[2] == &quot;Evelyn&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;That&#39;s right!&quot; shouts Evelyn Cox. &quot;$name&#39;s never said boo to a ghost. Why don&#39;t you flush yourself down the drain with all the other drips?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;\
&lt;&lt;if $path.includes(&quot;open school interview&quot;)&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Then the crowd parts slightly, and a booming adult voice says, &quot;Say, what&#39;s all this? You kids should clear out and head home. It&#39;s Friday, for Pete&#39;s sake.&quot; The adult emerges into the center of the crowd, and you can see that it&#39;s Elias Dahl, the newspaperman. &quot;$name!&quot; he says to you. &quot;I hope you&#39;re not mixed up in this.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;It&#39;s just a bully, Mr Dahl,&quot; you say. &quot;Someone shooting off $poss[$bgen] mouth, that&#39;s all.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Dahl turns on $bully. &quot;What&#39;s with you?&quot; he demands. &quot;This poor kid&#39;s got a condition. You must know about it, it was in your newspaper. I&#39;m here to write it up for the //Herald.// People have to know about this. It&#39;s not $poss[$gen] fault, see?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Trembling, $bully points at you. &quot;$nomcap[$sgen]&#39;s a freak!&quot; $nom[$bgen] cries.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;It&#39;s just a condition, &lt;&lt;if $bgen == 3&gt;&gt;son,&quot;&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;miss,&quot;&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; Dahl says in a kindly voice, leaning down. &quot;The doctors are working on it right now. Soon it&#39;ll be all better. You&#39;re not //afraid// of doctors, are you?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;The expression on $bully&#39;s face says $nom[$bgen]&#39;s afraid of //something,// because $nom[$bgen] looks like $nom[$bgen]&#39;s about to flee into the crowd.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;\
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Things seem to have gone far enough. You&#39;re going to have to do something.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;That&#39;s right, isn&#39;t it?&quot; $bully asks, sneering at you. &quot;Ever since you showed up at school this year, this whole Zeta thing has started going around.

&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Then let me tell you,&quot; $bully says. &quot;Maybe nobody else noticed, but I sure did. How you&#39;ve been missing school. How you&#39;ve been turning up, looking tired. How your clothes don&#39;t fit. You thought you could just lie to everyone, and nobody was going to notice?

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;You leave $acc[$sogen] out of this,&quot; you warn $acc[$bgen].&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;$bully seems to recognize that $nom[$bgen]&#39;s scored a hit. &quot;You want to talk about someone else? How about the way you and $fr are always sitting together at lunch. I bet //$nom[$fgen]// really likes how you get turned into a $girlboy[$soppgen].

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You look around and see $fr&#39;s pale, shocked face.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;You were just thinking about yourself, probably,&quot; $bully says. &quot;So what, right? There&#39;s a disease going around turning $girlsboys[$sgen] into $girlsboys[$soppgen], but so what? You&#39;ll just show up and not tell anyone, so we can //all// catch it.

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;It&#39;s not catching,&quot; you try to explain, but the eerie silence in the crowd shows that you don&#39;t have anyone on your side.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&lt;&lt;if $path.includes(&quot;oops&quot;)&gt;&gt;&quot;And now look at you,&quot; $nom[$bgen] says mockingly. &quot;It happened again, didn&#39;t it?

Maybe some panties? Garter? Stockings?&quot;&lt;&lt;elseif $sex == &quot;female&quot;&gt;&gt;You got some trousers in your locker, maybe, just in case? Maybe some boxer shorts? A nice jock strap?&quot;&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;&quot;And now look at you,&quot; $nom[$bgen] says mockingly. &quot;Showing up to school looking like that.

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Easy for you to talk,&quot; $bully drawls. &quot;$name wasn&#39;t lying to //you,// was $nom[$sgen]? Just the rest of us. Putting us all in danger. You probably didn&#39;t mind when $name turned into a $girlboy[$soppgen].&quot;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&lt;&lt;if $fight == &quot;punch&quot;&gt;&gt;Closing your fists and taking up a sparring stance that you learned in Scouts, you get in a couple of solid jabs to the chest, and $bully is knocked back, surprised and winded. $nomcap[$bgen] tries flinging a right at your head, but it&#39;s easy to catch $poss[$bgen] arm on your left and throw another punch right back. $bully takes a step back toward the rail, gathering up some speed, and hurls $reflana[$bgen] at you, fists flying. But this technique is clumsy, and you step left and plant one fist on the side of $poss[$bgen] head. $posscap[$bgen] eyes roll back, $poss[$bgen] goes limp, and $nom[$bgen] hits the deck face first. He opens his blurry eyes and crawls to the other rail, hoisting himself up woozily.&lt;&lt;elseif $fight == &quot;grab&quot;&gt;&gt;You approach $bully with your hands open, prepared to use your masculine size as an advantage without intending to hurt $acc[$bgen]. $nomcap[$bgen] lunges at you, $poss[$bgen] a face a snarling mask, preparing to kick and pinch and scratch anything $nom[$bgen] can. This approach is clumsy, and you&#39;re able to seize hold of one of $bully&#39;s wrists &lt;&lt;if $strength gte 57&gt;&gt;without any difficulty at all. Her slender arm in your hand is completely captive.&lt;&lt;elseif $strength gte 53&gt;&gt;without much difficulty. She pulls at her slender arm in futility, and cannot free herself from your grasp.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;with only a little difficulty. She wrenches her slender arm around, but you manage to keep your grip secure.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; You&#39;re able to use your leverage and turn her around in place, holding her with both arms from behind. $bully struggles, but can&#39;t break free. Finally, disgusted, you push her away, heaving her easily toward the opposite railing.&lt;&lt;elseif $fight == &quot;slap&quot;&gt;&gt;You approach $bully, trying to stay wary. $nomcap[$bgen] lunges at you, $poss[$bgen] a face a snarling mask, preparing to kick and pinch and scratch anything $nom[$bgen] can. You manage to push away her grasping, claw-like hands and catch her a ringing slap across the face. Her eyes open wide, and she looks angry, but you push her backward against the rail. She hits it hard in the small of her back, then goes down on her hands and knees. Sniffing, she clings to the other stair railing and hauls herself to her feet.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;You approach $bully, trying to stay wary, knowing he has an advantage of size and strength. However, as you leap at him with your hands formed into claws, it&#39;s easy to see he was unprepared for your ferocity. He might be able to bat your scratching nails away most of the time, but you still manage to slap him hard across the mouth, pinch his sensitive ear, and hit him once in the throat. He staggers away to the opposite railing and props himself against it.&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

I don&#39;t know why you decided to pick on me, &lt;&lt;if $openzeta == true or $path.includes(&quot;oops&quot;)&gt;&gt;or why you&#39;re being such a pill because I&#39;m a Zeta,&lt;&lt;elseif $newid == true or $oldid == true&gt;&gt;or why you&#39;re trying to convince everybody I&#39;m a Zeta,&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;or why you think everybody should be afraid of me for being a Zeta or whatever,&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; but it&#39;s not going to work. People like me here, because I&#39;m nice to them. If you want people to like you back, maybe you should try being a little nicer.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;$bully scowls at you. &quot;I don&#39;t care if people like me.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Yes you do,&quot; you say. &quot;Everybody does. Why don&#39;t you just split, and let us all go home? This is just stupid.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;$bully looks around at the different faces in the crowd, and weighs $poss[$bgen] chances. It would not do to start a fight against a group like this, but walking away would certainly mean losing face. &quot;Fine,&quot; $nom[$bgen] says after a minute. &quot;I didn&#39;t want to beat up a little pipsqueak like you anyway.&quot; $nomcap[$bgen] turns and clumps down the school steps toward the sidewalk.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;if $path.includes(&quot;bully calls out friend&quot;)&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Way to go,&quot; $fr says, in a subdued voice.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Thanks!&quot; you say, beaming. &quot;I didn&#39;t know I had it in me! I&#39;m just glad I didn&#39;t hurt.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Yeah. Lucky.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Something wrong?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Yeah,&quot; $fr says, glancing away. &quot;I didn&#39;t really appreciate the way $bully dragged me into everything like that.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I know. I&#39;m sorry. That was mean.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Well, you&#39;re used to it,&quot; $fr says, gesturing toward you. &quot;Everything you&#39;ve gone through. I kind of wanted to stay out of it.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Sure,&quot; you say, stung. &quot;I understand.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Gee,&quot; $fr says, grinning. &quot;That was amazing!&quot;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;That was so lucky!&quot; $fr agrees.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Would you mind going on the record, then?&quot; Dahl asks, opening his notebook and taking a pencil from his ear. &quot;What&#39;s your name?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;

You can tell it&#39;s because $nom[$bgen] is trying to sound firm and sure, but $nom[$bgen] only sounds agitated and guilty. &quot;So don&#39;t go printing that, either.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;If you want to go off the record--&quot; Dahl begins.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Get lost, I said!&quot; $bully says, backing down the steps. Then $nom[$bgen] turns and flees for the safety of the sidewalk.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Interesting,&quot; Dahl says. Looking around, he asks, &quot;Is there anybody else here who would like to weigh in on this new condition? I could use a few quotes.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;After the reporter has gone, $fr comes up to you. &quot;That was pretty amazing. Good thing that reporter was here, huh?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Yes. I&#39;m just lucky I didn&#39;t get hurt. Hopefully that&#39;s the last we&#39;ll see of $bully for a while, too.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;

There&#39;s nothing wrong with being a $girlboy[$sogen]. Half the kids at this school are $girlsboys[$sogen]. It&#39;s just a temporary condition. I&#39;m sure they&#39;ll come up with a cure for it.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Yeah, like polio, right?&quot; $bully asks, with a caustic look. &quot;They sure cured //that// right up. I&#39;m sure I heard about it somewhere.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;There is some muted laughter from the crowd.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;If you&#39;re so scared of Zeta, then why don&#39;t you hit the road?&quot; you suggest. &quot;No point hanging around here. You might catch it yourself and turn into a $girlboy[$soppgen].&quot;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;More laughter, but this time some of it is directed at $bully.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Laugh it up,&quot; $bully says, glaring around at the sea of faces. &quot;This little liar here has probably already infected half of //you.// It won&#39;t be quite as funny then, will it?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;The crowd goes silent.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;No,&quot; you say. &quot;No, it won&#39;t be funny. But they&#39;ll all remember what a jerk //you// were about it. So I&#39;d think about that.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Yes, on your way //home,//&quot; $so says, hinting broadly. &quot;Which is where you should be //going.//&quot;&lt;/div&gt;

The crowd sighs as one at your confidence, and at $bully&#39;s powerlessness.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Shall we walk home together as far as we can?&quot; you ask. &quot;In case $bully decides to follow?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Yes,&quot; $so says, sounding subdued. &quot;That&#39;s a good idea.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Is something wrong?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Nothing,&quot; $so says, but you can tell that&#39;s not exactly true.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I //don&#39;t,//&quot; $bully says sullenly.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;So that&#39;s why you&#39;re here? Because you don&#39;t care?&quot; you ask, and the murmur that runs through the crowd indicates that you&#39;re not alone in your thinking. &quot;I think you do. I think you might even be jealous.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Jealous? In your dreams!&quot;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;$bully looks down, startled, when $nom[$bgen] discovers $nom[$bgen] had backed up against the railing without realizing it. &quot;Jealous? Of you?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;

Wouldn&#39;t you like to try it and see?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You take another step toward $bully, but now $nom[$bgen] is backing down the school steps, along the rail, inching toward the sidewalk. &quot;You keep away from me!&quot; $nom[$bgen] says. &quot;Stop trying to give me your freak Zeta disease!&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;I didn&#39;t give it to you,&quot; you say. &quot;You already //have// it. That&#39;s what you&#39;re afraid of, isn&#39;t it?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;You get away from me!&quot; $bully shouts at you, and turns on $poss[$bgen] heel and runs down the last few steps to the safety of the street.&lt;/div&gt;

Marvin just nods at you as you get back in line with the other drummers.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;But the funny feeling doesn&#39;t go away.&lt;/div&gt;

Clean, handsome faces. With large hands.&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;It doesn&#39;t help that you&#39;re standing amid a crowd of handsome young men, and a few young women.

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;The heat in your body returns without warning, making you dizzy.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;//Wait, wait!// you think. //Oh no, not again.//&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Then it&#39;s surging through you again, making your skin blaze, making your bones creak, as if you&#39;re being compacted down into a smaller space, boiling away, being reduced. You can practically feel your hair growing and your manhood sizzling into nothingness.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;When the feeling subsides, you realize you&#39;re on your hands and knees, breathing hard. And you&#39;re a girl again.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Tiny body. Long hair. Delicate little hands. Big bottom. And breasts poking through your shirt, because you ditched your heavy concealing sweater in your locker.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;$band is standing over you, with a look of surprise and horror. &quot;What&#39;s this?&quot; he demands.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;When the band grinds to the end of the school fight song, $band nods in your direction. &quot;I see that your condition is ... no laughing matter,&quot; he says. &quot;I trust that will not happen when you are marching with the band next week?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;The heat in your body returns without warning, making you dizzy.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;//Wait, wait!// you think. //Oh no, not again.//&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Then it&#39;s surging through you, burning your skin, stretching your bones like someone is playing tug-of-war with your skeleton, and your muscles start to clench up like fists, and your head is breaking apart--&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;When the feeling subsides, you realize you&#39;re on your hands and knees, breathing hard. And you&#39;re a boy again.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Long legs. Strong bones. Big hands. Stubble on your face. Testing the limits of your pale blue dress.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;No,&quot; you protest weakly. &quot;I&#39;m just--&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;$pep claps her hands briskly. &quot;All right girls, stand back. We don&#39;t know if this is contagious and I&#39;m not losing my whole squad. Come on, back away.&quot; When they have cleared a space around you, $pep grabs your arm and tries -- and fails -- to haul you to your feet.

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;That&#39;s some condition you have, Miss $lastname,&quot; $pep says at last. &quot;I assume you&#39;re not going to do that trick during our drill next week at the football game?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Oh, yes,&quot; she says, rising from her desk. At the same time, a man stands up from the wooden chair opposite her desk. He&#39;s in his thirties, and has a rumpled brown suit and a dark hat, and in his hands he has a notebook. &quot;Yes,&quot; Mrs Decker says, approaching the counter. &quot;$currname, this is Mr Dahl of the West Seattle //Herald.// He asked to see you.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;You can call me Elias,&quot; he says, shaking your hand. &quot;You may know my daughter, Sophie. She goes to this same school, although she&#39;s a senior this year, so you may not. I saw the article in your little school paper the other day — Sophie brought it home, she&#39;s on the newspaper staff — and I was intrigued by your story. I made a few phone calls to some local doctors — wonderful people, of course, but there&#39;s confidentiality to think of — but they confirmed that this Zeta Chromosome Syndrome is really happening to people in this area, and I thought I&#39;d come by to see if you&#39;d mind doing an interview for the //Herald// as well.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;He talks very fast, as if trying to get every one of his thoughts into a single sentence so they can&#39;t escape. Nevertheless, he has an eager, sincere look about him, although slightly hunched over as he leans into the conversation.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Well, sure,&quot; you say. &quot;What&#39;s the harm in that? I&#39;ve told my story to Floyd, so it&#39;s already out there.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;That&#39;s excellent,&quot; he says with a smile, and turns to the secretary. &quot;You don&#39;t suppose I could just do the interview now? It would only take an hour or so, maybe a little longer.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Oh, $poss[$sgen] teachers won&#39;t mind,&quot; Mrs Decker says. &quot;$nomcap[$sgen]&#39;s a model student. A &lt;&lt;if $startsex == &quot;male&quot;&gt;&gt;Boy&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;Girl&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; Scout, you know.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Really?&quot; Dahl asks, &lt;&lt;if $startsex == $sex&gt;&gt;impressed. &quot;So&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;startled. &quot;Oh, yes, I suppose — you don&#39;t look — ah, anyway, &lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt; we can do the interview now?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;It&#39;ll be just ducky,&quot; Mrs Decker assures him. &quot;I&#39;ll send one of my senior assistants around.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;The interview actually takes quite a bit longer than an hour. You spend the entirety of your last three periods talking about your experiences with the reporter. His questions are much more considered and attentive than Floyd&#39;s had been -- this is a real professional at work, after all -- and you are a little more guarded in your answers, particularly when it comes to $so. You&#39;re not about to make the same mistake again. When Dahl presses you on the subject of teenage romance, you tell him there&#39;s someone you&#39;re interested in, but you&#39;d rather not discuss it for the newspaper.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Fair enough,&quot; Dahl says. &quot;I imagime you&#39;ve had some difficulty with the Scouts, as well. Tell me more about that.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;&lt;set _confident to true&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;if $path.includes(&quot;new scout troop&quot;)&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You explain that you&#39;ve had to move to a new scout troop for $girlsboys[$soppgen] in order to continue accruing merit badges, and you&#39;re going on your first group camping trip tomorrow.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;First one, eh?&quot; he asks. &quot;I should try to attend, and bring a photographer along. We could include that as part of the story.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&lt;&lt;if $sex == $startsex&gt;&gt;&quot;I don&#39;t know about that, mister,&quot; you say dubiously. &quot;I&#39;m not sure I can go. I&#39;m not exactly the right shape at the moment.&quot;&lt;&lt;set _confident to false&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;&quot;I can give you the troop leader&#39;s name, if you like,&quot; you say. &quot;It&#39;s already been arranged.&quot;&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You explain that you&#39;ve had some difficulty figuring out how to pursue your scouting career, given everything that&#39;s happened to you.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Well, I shouldn&#39;t wonder,&quot; Dahl says, nodding. &quot;I could talk to your troop leader and get $poss[$sgen] perspective.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&lt;&lt;if $path.includes(&quot;tell scouts&quot;)&gt;&gt;&quot;Sure, if you like,&quot; you say. &quot;I&#39;ve already explained what&#39;s happened.&quot;&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;set _confident to false&gt;&gt;&quot;I don&#39;t know about that, mister,&quot; you say dubiously. &quot;I haven&#39;t exactly told them yet. It&#39;s all been so sudden.&quot;&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;\
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&lt;&lt;if _confident == true&gt;&gt;Elias Dahl takes down the name of your scout leader and the troop number. &quot;The article mentioned that you have had to change some of your classes. Tell me how that&#39;s going.&quot;&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;&quot;Once the article goes in the paper, everybody&#39;s going to find out,&quot; the reporter says. &quot;So tell me — you&#39;ve had to change some of your classes around at school. How&#39;s that going?&quot;&lt;&lt;endif&gt;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;You cover a lot of the same ground as Floyd&#39;s article, but in much more depth and detail. Elias Dahl isn&#39;t satisfied with yes-or-no questions with easy answers.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Eventually, the bell rings for the end of the last class, and you realize that school is over.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&quot;Already?&quot; the reporter asks, and grins. &quot;I suppose I lost track of time. All right, thank you very much. I&#39;ll see about ringing up your scout troop later on, and perhaps I&#39;ll ask around with some of your teachers as well. Good luck!&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;Elias Dahl shakes your hand again, and leaves.&lt;/div&gt;
